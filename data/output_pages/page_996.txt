  Source Power Rule Considerations
The Source Power Rules are designed to:

Ensure the PDP Rating (PDP) of an adapter specified in watts explicitly defines the voltages and 
currents at each voltage the adapter supports.

Ensure that adapters with a large PDP Ratings are always capable of providing the power to devices 
designed for use with adapters with a smaller PDP Rating.

Enable an ecosystem of adapters that are inter-operable with the devices in the ecosystem.
The considerations that lead to the Source Power Rules are based are summarized in Table 10.1, "Considerations for 
Sources".

Considerations
Rationale
Consequence
Simple to identify capability
A user going into an electronics retailer 
knows what they need
Cannot have a complex identification 
scheme 
Higher power Sources are a superset of 
smaller ones
Bigger is always better in user’s eyes – don’t 
want a degradation in performance
Higher power Sources do everything smaller 
ones do
Unambiguous Source definitions
Sources with the same power rating but 
different VI combinations might not inter-
operate
To avoid user confusion, any given power 
rating has a single definition
A range of power ratings
Users and companies will want freedom to 
pick appropriate Source ratings
Fixed profiles at specific power levels don’t 
provide adequate flexibility, e.g., profiles as 
defined in previous versions of PD.
5V@3A USB Type-C Source is defined by 
[USB Type-C 2.4]
5V@3A USB Type-C Source is considered
All > 15W adapters must support 5V@3A or 
superset consideration is violated
Maximize 3A cable utilization
3A cables will be ubiquitous
Increase to maximum voltage (20V) before 
increasing current beyond 3A
Optimize voltage rail count
More rails are a higher burden for Sources, 
particularly in terms of testing
5V is a basic USB requirement. 48V provides 
the maximum capability. 
Some Sources are not able to provide 
significant power
Some small Battery-operated Sources e.g., 
mobile devices, are able to provide more 
power directly from their Battery than from 
a regulated 5V supply
In addition to the minimal 5V 
Advertisements are able to Advertise more 
power from their Battery
Some Sources share power between 
multiple Ports (Hubs and multi-Port 
Chargers)
Hubs and multi-port Chargers have to be 
supported
