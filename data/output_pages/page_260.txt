SourcePPSCommTimer Shall be re-initialized and restarted when, after receiving any Message that causes the 
Source to enter the PE_SRC_Ready state, the last bit of the corresponding GoodCRC Message EOP is transmitted by 
the PHY Layer.
The Source Shall stop the SourcePPSCommTimer when:

After receiving any Message that causes the Source to leave the PE_SRC_Ready state, the last bit of the 
of the corresponding GoodCRC Message EOP is sent by the PHY Layer, or

The last bit of any Signaling is received by the PHY Layer from the Sink by the Source that causes the 
Source to leave the PE_SRC_Ready state.
When the SourcePPSCommTimer times out the Source Shall issue Hard Reset Signaling.
6.6.20
  tEnterUSB
The DFP Shall send the Enter_USB Message within tEnterUSB of either:

The last bit of the GoodCRC acknowledging the Data_Reset_Complete Message in response to the 
Data_Reset Message or

A PD Connection, specifically the last bit of the GoodCRC acknowledging the Source_Capabilities Mes-
sage after the initial entry into the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state or 

The last bit of the GoodCRC acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the DR_Swap Message
Failure by the DFP to meet this timeout parameter can result in the ports not transitioning into [USB4] operation. 
Any AMS initiated by the UFP prior to receiving the Enter_USB Message will delay reception of the Enter_USB 
Message and [USB4] operation, therefore a USB4® -capable UFP Should Not initiate any AMS until the DFP has been 
given time to send the Enter_USB Message.

  EPR Timers
6.6.21.1
  SinkEPREnterTimer Timer
The SinkEPREnterTimer is used to ensure the EPR Mode entry process completes within tEnterEPR. The Sink 
Shall start the timer when it sees the last bit of the GoodCRC Message in response to the EPR_Mode Message with 
the Action field set to 1 (Enter). The Sink Shall stop the timer when the last bit of the corresponding GoodCRC 
Message EOP, corresponding to the received EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 3 (Enter Succeeded), 
has been transmitted by the PHY Layer. If the timer expires the Sink Shall send a Soft_Reset Message.
6.6.21.2
  SinkEPRKeepAlive Timer
The SinkEPRKeepAliveTimer Shall be used by the Sink's Policy Engine to ensure that communication between the 
Sink and Source occurs within a bounded time of tSinkEPRKeepAlive. The Sink Shall initialize and run this timer 
upon entry into the PE_SNK_Ready State when in EPR Mode and Shall stop it upon exit from the PE_SNK_Ready 
when in EPR Mode.
While operating in EPR Mode, the Sink Shall stop the SinkEPRKeepAliveTimer timer whenever:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, in response any Message from the Source, is transmitted by 
the PHY Layer.

The PHY Layer receives the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP in response to any Message sent to the 
Source.
If the timer expires the Sink Shall send an EPR_KeepAlive Message.
6.6.21.3
  SourceEPRKeepAlive Timer
The SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer Shall be used by the Source's Policy Engine to ensure that communication 
between the Sink and Source occurs within a bounded time of tSourceEPRKeepAlive. The Source Shall initialize
