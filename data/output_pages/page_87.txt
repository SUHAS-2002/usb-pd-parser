This inversion of the CRC-32 remainder adds an offset of FFFF_FFFFh that will create a constant CRC-32 residual of 
C704_DD7Bh at the receiver side. 
Note:
The CRC implementation is identical to the one used in [USB 3.2].
Figure 5.4, "CRC-32 Generation" is an illustration of CRC-32 generation. The output bit ordering Shall be as detailed 
in Table 5.10, "CRC-32 Mapping".
