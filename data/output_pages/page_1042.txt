If the laptop has detected that it is connected via 
an Active Cable (or one that supports Alternate 
Modes) and/or that it can support an FRS, it 
initiates a VCONN Swap to make itself the VCONN 
Source. This removes a requirement that the Hub 
to hold up VCONN during the FRS. 
18
Normal PD Power traffic flow
19
The Hub and laptop are now ready to do a Fast Role Swap in case the power adapter gets removed.

Step #

Laptop
0
Hub is connected to laptop.
1
Laptop sources 5 V to VBUS (vSafe5V).
Laptop sources 5 V to VCONN
2
Laptop reads the cable to check its current carrying 
capability and/or if it is an Active Cable requiring 
VCONN.
3
Laptop sends Source_Capabilities Message
4
Hub sends Request Message
5
Hub and laptop establish an Explicit Contract with Hub as Sink.
6
Laptop sends a Get_Source_Cap Message to 
determine how much power the Hub can provide
7
Hub sends a Source_Capabilities Message with the 
Dual-Role Power bit set, and Unconstrained Power 
bit cleared, and Maximum Current = 0.
8
Since the Hub cannot supply power, the laptop does 
not send a PR_Swap Message
9
The power adapter is connected to the Hub
10
If the Hub can source more than 3A, it initiates a VCONN 
Swap to become the VCONN Source. 
11
Hub reads the e-marker to determine the cable’s 
current carrying capability.
12
Hub initiates a Power Role Swap to become the Source
13
Hub sends a Source_Capabilities Message with the 
Unconstrained Power bit set and Maximum Current > 
0.
14
Hub and laptop establish an Explicit Contract with Hub as source.
15
Laptop sends a Get_Sink_Cap Message to determine 
the current required by the Hub to support an FRS. If 
the Hub does not support FRS or the laptop cannot 
supply the required current, the laptop Ignores any 
Fast Role Swap Requests it might see.
