Figure D.4 Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 
2.0 Noise
To remove the high frequency content of the [USB 2.0] noise, Finite Difference technique with the proper time 
interval is applied to the BMC waveform with [USB 2.0] noise in Figure D.3, "Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 
2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise". Using Backward Finite Difference Calculator, ΔVcc = Vcc (t) - Vcc(t- Δt), 
Figure D.5, "BMC Signal and Finite Difference Output with Various Time Steps" shows the Finite Difference Output 
while Δt = 500ns. The larger the time interval Δt is, the larger the peak-to-peak magnitude of the Finite Difference 
Output will be. However, the time interval is bounded by the rise time of the BMC signal so that 300ns to 500ns is 
a good range of the time interval.

  Data Recovery 
The edge detection is followed by the Finite Difference Calculation. At the input of the edge detector, if the voltage 
is larger than Vth, H at the rising edge, the output will become high voltage level, VH, if the voltage is smaller than 
Vth, L at the falling edge, the output will become low voltage level, VL. In this example, Vth, H and Vth, L are 0.2V and 
-0.2V, respectively. The solid curve in Figure D.6, "Output of Finite Difference in dash line and Edge Detector in solid 
line" represents the output of the edge detector, where VH is 0.5V and VL is -0.5V.
