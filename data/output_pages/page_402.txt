Initial Sink Port  New Source Port
Fast Role Swap Request and Power Transition
A
The Source connected to the Hub UFP (see Figure 
7.16, "VBUS Power during Fast Role Swap") stops 
sourcing VBUS.
B
Policy Engine sends the Fast Role Swap Request to the 
Initial Sink on the CC wire. When VBUS < vSafe5V 
(min), it tells the Device Policy Manager not to draw 
more than iSnkStdby until the tSnkFRSwap timer 
has elapsed.
C
Policy Engine detects the Fast Role Swap Request on 
the CC wire from the Initial Source and Shall send 
the FR_Swap Message back to the Initial Source (that 
is no longer powering VBUS) within time 
tFRSwapInit.
D1
The Policy Engine monitors for VBUS ≤ vSafe5V so 
that a PS_RDY Message can be sent to the New Source 
at Step 5 of the messaging sequence.
D2
The Policy Engine monitors for VBUS ≤ vSafe5V so the 
Initial Sink can assume the Power Role of New Source 
and begin to source VBUS.
E
When VBUS = vSafe5V the New Source May provide 
power to VBUS. When VBUS < vSafe5V the New Source 
Shall provide power to VBUS within tSrcFRSwap.
Once the New Source is providing power, the PS_RDY 
Message can be sent to the New Sink at Step 7 of the 
messaging sequence.
F
The CC termination is changed from Rp to Rd (see 
[USB Type-C 2.4]) before the New Sink sends the 
PS_RDY Message at Step 5 to the New Source.
G
The CC termination is changed from Rd to Rp (see 
[USB Type-C 2.4]) before the New Source sends the 
PS_RDY Message at Step 7 to the New Sink.
Fast Role Swap Message Sequence
 1
Policy Engine receives the FR_Swap Message from 
the Initial Sink that is transitioning to be the New 
Source.
Policy Engine sends the FR_Swap Message to the 
Initial Source (that is no longer powering VBUS) after 
detecting the Fast Role Swap Request at Step C.
2
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Initial Sink. Policy Engine then evaluates the 
FR_Swap Message.
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Initial Source.
3
Policy Engine sends an Accept Message to the Initial 
Sink that is transitioning to be the New Source.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message from the 
Initial Source that is transitioning to be the New Sink.
4
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Initial Sink that is transitioning to be the New 
Source.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Initial Source that is transitioning to be the New Sink.
