6.6.10.2
  tDataReset
The DFP Shall complete the Data_Reset process (as defined in Section 6.3.14, "Data_Reset Message") within 
tDataReset of the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Accept Message, being transmitted 
by the PHY Layer.
6.6.10.3
  DataResetFailTimer
The DataResetFailTimer Shall be used by the DFP's Policy Engine to ensure the Data Reset process completes 
within tDataResetFail of the last bit of the GoodCRC acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the 
Data_Reset Message. If the DFP's DataResetFailTimer expires, the DFP Shall enter the ErrorRecovery State.
6.6.10.4
  DataResetFailUFPTimer
The DataResetFailUFPTimer Shall be used by the UFP's Policy Engine to ensure the Data Reset process completes 
within tDataResetFailUFP of the last bit of the GoodCRC acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the 
Data_Reset Message. If the UFP's DataResetFailUFPTimer expires, the UFP Shall enter the ErrorRecovery State.
6.6.11
  Hard Reset Timers
6.6.11.1
  HardResetCompleteTimer
The HardResetCompleteTimer is used by the Protocol Layer in the case where it has asked the PHY Layer to send 
Hard Reset Signaling and the PHY Layer is unable to send the Signaling within a reasonable time due to a non-Idle 
channel. If the PHY Layer does not indicate that the Hard Reset Signaling has been sent within tHardResetComplete 
of the Protocol Layer requesting transmission, then the Protocol Layer Shall inform the Policy Engine that the Hard 
Reset Signaling has been sent in order to ensure the power supply is reset in a timely fashion.
6.6.11.2
  PSHardResetTimer
The PSHardResetTimer is used by the Policy Engine in a Source to ensure that the Sink has had sufficient time to 
process Hard Reset Signaling before turning off its power supply to VBUS. 
When a Hard Reset occurs the Source, stops driving VCONN, removes Rp from the CC pin and starts to transition the 
VBUS voltage to vSafe0V either:

tPSHardReset after the last bit of the Hard Reset Signaling has been received from the Sink or 

tPSHardReset after the last bit of the Hard Reset Signaling has been sent by the Source.
See Section 7.1.5, "Response to Hard Resets".
6.6.11.3
  tDRSwapHardReset
If a DR_Swap Message is received during Modal Operation then a Hard Reset Shall be initiated by the recipient of 
the unexpected DR_Swap Message; Hard Reset Signaling Shall be generated within tDRSwapHardReset of the EOP 
of the GoodCRC sent in response to the DR_Swap Message.
6.6.11.4
  tProtErrHardReset
If a Protocol Error occurs that directly leads to a Hard Reset, the transmission of the Hard Reset Signaling Shall be 
completed within tProtErrHardReset of the EOP of the GoodCRC sent in response to the Message that caused the 
Protocol Error.
6.6.12
  Structured VDM Timers
6.6.12.1
  VDMResponseTimer
The VDMResponseTimer Shall be used by the Initiator's Policy Engine to ensure that a Structured VDM Command 
request needing a response (e.g. Discover Identity Command request) is responded to within a bounded time of 
tVDMSenderResponse. The VDMResponseTimer Shall be applied to all Structured VDM Commands except the
