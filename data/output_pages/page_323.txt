Figure 7.10 Source VBUS and VCONN Response to Hard Reset
VCONN will meet tVCONNDischarge relative to the start of the voltage transition as shown in Figure 7.10, "Source VBUS 
and VCONN Response to Hard Reset" due to the discharge circuitry in the Cable Plug. VCONN Shall meet tVCONNOn 
relative to VBUS reaching vSafe5V. 
Note:
tVCONNOn and tVCONNDischarge are defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
7.1.6
  Changing the Output Power Capability
Some USB Power Delivery Negotiations will require the Source to adjust its output power capability without 
changing the output voltage. In this case the Source Shall be able to supply a higher or lower load current within 
tSrcReady.

  Robust Source Operation
7.1.7.1
  Output Over Current Protection 
Sources Shall implement over current protection to prevent damage from output current that exceeds the current 
handling capability of the Source. The definition of current handling capability is left to the discretion of the Source 
implementation and Shall take into consideration the current handling capability of the connector contacts. If the 
over current protection implementation does not use a Hard Reset or Error Recovery, it Shall Not interfere with the 
Negotiated VBUS current level.
After three consecutive over current events Source Shall go to ErrorRecovery.
Sources Should attempt to send Hard Reset Signaling when over current protection engages followed by an Alert 
Message indicating an OCP event once an Explicit Contract has been established. The over current protection 
response May engage at either the Port or system level. Systems or ports that have engaged over current protection 
Should attempt to resume USB Default Operation after determining that the cause of over current is no longer 
present and May latch off to protect the Port or system. The definition of how to detect if the cause of over current 
is still present is left to the discretion of the Source implementation.
The Source Shall Re-negotiate with the Sink after choosing to resume USB Default Operation. The decision of how 
to Re-negotiate after an over current event is left to the discretion of the Source implementation.
The Source Shall prevent continual system or Port cycling if over current protection continues to engage after 
initially resuming either USB Default Operation or Re-negotiation. Latching off the Port or system is an acceptable 
response to recurring over current.
During the over current response and subsequent system or Port shutdown, all affected Source ports operating 
with VBUS greater than vSafe5V Shall discharge VBUS to vSafe5V by the time tSafe5V and vSafe0V by the time 
tSafe0V.
