4)
The DiscoverIdentityTimer is run when this is a VCONN Source and a PD Connection with a Cable Plug needs to be es-
tablished i.e. no GoodCRC Message has yet been received in response to a Discover Identity Command.
5)
The SinkPPSPeriodicTimer is only initialized and run when the present Explicit Contract is for an SPR PPS APDO. 
Sinks that do not support PPS do not need to implement the SinkPPSPeriodicTimer.
6)
A Sink that is a VPD May use VCONN as a proxy for VBUS.
7)
To be sent once, and only required if Fast Role Swap is supported by the Sink.
8.3.3.3.1
  PE_SNK_Startup State
PE_SNK_Startup Shall be the starting state for a Sink Policy Engine either on power up or after a Hard Reset. On 
entry to this state the Policy Engine Shall reset the Protocol Layer.
Note:
Resetting the Protocol Layer will also reset the MessageIDCounter and stored MessageID (see Section 
6.12.2.3, "Protocol Layer Message Reception").
Once the reset process completes, the Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Discovery state.
8.3.3.3.2
  PE_SNK_Discovery State
In the PE_SNK_Discovery state the Sink Policy Engine waits for VBUS to be present.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that VBUS has been detected.
8.3.3.3.3
  PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities State
On entry to the PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state the Policy Engine Shall initialize and start the 
SinkWaitCapTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Evaluate_Capability state when:

The Sink is in SPR Mode and a Source_Capabilities Message is received or

The Sink is in EPR Mode and an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message is received.
When the SinkWaitCapTimer times out, the Policy Engine will perform a Hard Reset.
8.3.3.3.4
  PE_SNK_Evaluate_Capability State
The PE_SNK_Evaluate_Capability state is first entered when the Sink receives its first Source_Capabilities 
Message from the Source. At this point the Sink knows that it is Attached to and communicating with a PD capable 
Source.
On entry to the PE_SNK_Evaluate_Capability state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager to 
evaluate the supplied Source Capabilities based on Local Policy. The Device Policy Manager Shall indicate to the 
Policy Engine the new power level required, selected from the present offered capabilities. The Device Policy 
Manager Shall also indicate to the Policy Engine a Capabilities Mismatch if the offered power does not meet the 
device's requirements.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Select_Capability state when:

A response is received from the Device Policy Manager.
8.3.3.3.5
  PE_SNK_Select_Capability State
On entry to the PE_SNK_Select_Capability state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send a 
response Message, based on the evaluation from the Device Policy Manager. The Message Shall be one of the 
following:

A Request from the offered Source Capabilities.
