If Structured VDMs are supported, but the Structured VDM Command request is an Unrecognized Message, it Shall 
be NAKed (see Table 6.32, "Commands and Responses").
6.4.4.2.6.2
  Attention Command
The Command field contains the value for the VDM Command being sent (Attention). The Attention Command 
May be used by the Initiator to notify the Responder that it requires service. 
A Structured VDM Attention Command consists of a Command request but no Command response. A Structured 
VDM Attention Command is deemed to be completed when the GoodCRC Message has been successfully received 
by the Initiator in reply to its Attention Command request.
If Structured VDMs are supported, but the Structured VDM Attention Command request is an Unrecognized Message 
it Shall be Ignored (see Table 6.32, "Commands and Responses").
6.4.4.3
  Use of Commands
The VDM Header for a Structured VDM Message defines Commands used to retrieve a list of SVIDs the device 
supports, to discover the Modes associated with each SVID, and to enter/exit the Modes. The Commands include:

Discover Identity

Discover SVIDs

Discover Modes

Enter Mode

Exit Mode

Attention
Additional Command space is also Reserved for Standard and Vendor use and for future extensions. 
The Command AMSs use the terms Initiator and Responder to identify messaging roles the ports are taking on 
relative to each other. This role is independent of the Port's power capability (Provider, Consumer etc.) or its 
present Power Role (Source or Sink). The Initiator is the Port sending the initial Command request and the 
Responder is the Port replying with the Command response. See Section 6.4.4.4, "Command Processes".
All Ports that support Modes Shall support the Discover Identity, Discover SVIDs, the Discover Modes, the Enter 
Mode and Exit Mode Commands.
Table 6.32, "Commands and Responses" details the responses a Responder May issue to each Command request. 
Responses not listed for a given Command Shall Not be sent by a Responder. A NAK response Should be taken as 
an indication not to retry that particular Command.
Examples of Command usage can be found in Appendix C, "VDM Command Examples".
