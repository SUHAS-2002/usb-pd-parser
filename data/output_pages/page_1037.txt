  Noise Zone and Detection Zone 
The zone definition is the same as defined in Section D.1.4, "Noise Zone and Detection Zone". The sizes of the noise 
zone and detection zone of the Subtraction Scheme are dependent on the filter time constant. When the time 
constant of the first and second LPF are 200ns and 300ns, respectively, Vdetect is 250mV and Vnoise is 50mV. It is 
highly recommended that the product implemented with the similar techniques indicates the performance with 
the range of Vnoise and Vdetect in the electrical specification.
