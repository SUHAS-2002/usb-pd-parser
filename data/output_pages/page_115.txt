  Messages
This specification defines three types of Messages:

Control Messages that are short and used to manage the Message flow between Port Partners or to 
exchange Messages that require no additional data. Control Messages are 16 bits in length.

Data Messages that are used to exchange information between a pair of Port Partners. Data Messages 
range from 48 to 240 bits in length. 

Some examples of Data Messages are:

Those used to expose Capabilities and Negotiate power.

Those used for the BIST.

Those that are Vendor Defined Messages.

Extended Messages that are used to exchange information between a pair of Port Partners. Extended 
Messages are up to MaxExtendedMsgLen bytes.

Some examples of Extended Messages are:

Those used for Source and Battery information.

Those used for Security.

Those used for Firmware Update.

Those that are Vendor Defined Extended Messages.
6.2.1
  Message Construction
All Messages Shall be composed of a Message Header and a variable length (including zero) data portion. A Message 
either originates in the Protocol Layer and is passed to the PHY Layer, or it is received by the PHY Layer and is 
passed to the Protocol Layer.
Figure 6.1, "USB Power Delivery Packet Format for a Control Message" illustrates a Control Message as part of a 
Packet showing the parts are provided by the Protocol Layer and PHY Layer.
