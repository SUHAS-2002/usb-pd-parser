1)
EPR Sources are disallowed from offering Fixed Supply voltages that are above the defined voltages for a given PDP, e.g., 36V is 
disallowed for any PDP of 140W or lower.
2)
The Fixed PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise either RoundDown (PDP/voltage) or RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA.
3)
EPR Sources Shall reject any request for more than the Advertised PDP, i.e., when output voltage and operating current requested 
in the Sink RDO is outside of the defined AVS voltage and current range represented by the Advertised PDP, the RDO will be rejected.
4)
The current available for a given AVS voltage is as indicated in this column. The current defined here is describing the top edge of 
the Valid Operating Region as illustrated in Figure 10.6, "Valid EPR AVS Operating Region". The AVS APDO does not have a 
Maximum Current field, so the maximum current has to be calculated from the PDP.
