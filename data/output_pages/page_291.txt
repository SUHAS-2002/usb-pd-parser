  Sink Protocol Layer Message Transmission State Diagram
Figure 6.65, "Sink Protocol Layer Message Transmission State Diagram" shows the state behavior for the Protocol 
Layer in a Sink when transmitting a Message.

6.12.2.2.3.1
  PRL_Tx_Snk_Start_of_AMS State
In the PRL_Tx_Snk_Start_of_AMS state the Protocol Layer waits for the first Message in a Sink initiated AMS.
The Protocol Layer in a Sink Shall transition from the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state to the 
PRL_Tx_Snk_Start_of_AMS state when:

A notification is received from the Policy Engine that the next Message the Sink will send is the start of 
an AMS.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Snk_Pending state when:

A Message request is received from the Policy Engine.
PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request
First Message in AMS notification received 
from Policy Engine
PRL_Tx_Snk_Pending
Actions on entry:
PRL_Tx_Layer_Reset_for_Transmit
PRL_Tx_Construct_Message
Soft Reset Message pending
Message pending (except Soft Reset) &
Rp = SinkTxOk
PRL_Tx_Snk_Start_of_AMS
Actions on entry:
Message Request from Policy Engine
