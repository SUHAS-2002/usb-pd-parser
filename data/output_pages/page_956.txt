  Sink EPR Mode Entry State Diagram
Figure 8.212, "Sink EPR Mode Entry State Diagram" shows the state diagram for an EPR Sink initiating the EPR Mode 
Entry process.

8.3.3.26.2.1
  PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Entry State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Entry state from the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

The DPM requests entry into EPR Mode.
On Entry to the PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Entry state the Policy Engine Shall send an EPR_Mode (Enter) Message 
and starts the SenderResponseTimer and the SinkEPREnterTimer.
Note:
The SinkEPREnterTimer Shall continue to run in every state until it is stopped or times out.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_EPR_Mode_Wait_For_Response state when:

An EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledge) Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Send_Soft_Reset state when:

An EPR_Mode Message is received which is not Enter Succeeded or
DPM Request EPR Mode Entry
