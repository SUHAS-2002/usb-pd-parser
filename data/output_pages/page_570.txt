  Data Role Swap, Initiated by UFP Operating as Sink (Wait)
Figure 8.42, "Data Role Swap with Wait, UFP operating as Sink initiates" shows an example sequence between a Port, 
which is initially a UFP (Device) and a Sink (Rd asserted), and a Port which is initially a DFP (Host) and a Source (Rp 
asserted). A Data Role Swap is initiated by the UFP. During the process the Port Partners maintain their operation 
as either a Source or a Sink (power and Rp/Rd remain constant) and the exchange of Data Roles is delayed with a 
wait.
