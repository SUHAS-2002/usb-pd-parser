The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Prepare_To_Send_Chunked_Message state when: 

An Extended Message Request is received from the Policy Engine, and the link is Chunking.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall Discard the Message Request and remain in the 
TCH_Wait_For_Message_Request_From_Policy_Engine state when: 

The Chunked Rx state is any other than RCH_Wait_For_Message_From_Protocol_Layer, and the 
Optional Abort Flag has not been implemented.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall Discard the Message Request and enter the TCH_Report_Error state when: 

The Chunked Rx state is any other than RCH_Wait_For_Message_From_Protocol_Layer and the 
Optional Abort Flag has been implemented.
6.12.2.1.3.2
  TCH_Pass_Down_Message State
On entry to the TCH_Pass_Down_Message state the Chunked Tx State Machine Shall pass the Message to the


The Message has been passed to the Protocol Layer.
6.12.2.1.3.3
  TCH_Wait_For_Transmision_Complete State
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Message_Sent state when: 

Message Transmitted has been received from the Protocol Layer.
