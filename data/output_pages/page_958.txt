  Source EPR Mode Exit State Diagram
Figure 8.213, "Source EPR Mode Exit State Diagram" shows the state diagram for an EPR Source initiating the EPR 
Mode exit process.

8.3.3.26.3.1
  PE_SRC_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SRC_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state from the PE_SRC_Ready state when:

The DPM requests exit from EPR Mode.
On Entry to the PE_SRC_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state the Policy Engine Shall send an EPR_Mode (Exit) Message.
On Exit from the PE_SRC_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state the Policy Engine Shall exit EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

The EPR_Mode (Exit) Message has been sent.
8.3.3.26.3.2
  PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received state from the PE_SRC_Ready state when:

An EPR_Mode (Exit) Message is received.
On Entry to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received state the Policy Engine Shall exit EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

In an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO and

EPR Mode has been exited.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

Not in an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO.
