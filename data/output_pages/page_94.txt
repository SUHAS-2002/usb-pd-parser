Transition

Transition
If the trailing edge results in the transmitter driving CC high (i.e., the final half-UI of the Frame is low, see Figure 
5.13, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by Zero with Low to High Last Transition" and 
Figure 5.14, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by One with Low to High Last Transition"), 
then the transmitter:

Shall continue to drive CC high for 1 UI.

Then Shall drive CC low for tHoldLowBMC.

Should release CC to high impedance as soon as possible after min tHoldLowBMC and Shall release CC 
by max tEndDriveBMC.
Figure 5.13, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by Zero with Low to High Last Transition" 
illustrates the ending of a BMC encoded Frame that ends with an encoded zero for which the final bit of the Frame 
is terminated by a low to high transition. Figure 5.14, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated 
by One with Low to High Last Transition" illustrates the ending of a BMC encoded Frame that ends with an encoded 
one for which the final bit of the Frame is terminated by a low to high transition. Both figures also illustrate the 
tInterFrameGap timing requirement before the start of the next Frame when the Port has either been transmitting 
or receiving the previous Frame (see Section 5.8.5.4, "Inter-Frame Gap").
