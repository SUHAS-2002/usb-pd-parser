The Optional Abort Flag is set.
6.12.2.1.3.7
  TCH_Sending_Chunked_Message State
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Wait_Chunk_Request state when: 

Message Transmitted is received from Protocol Layer and this was not the last chunk.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Message_Sent state when: 

Message Transmitted is received from Protocol Layer and this was the last chunk.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Report_Error state when: 

Transmission Error has been received from the Protocol Layer.
6.12.2.1.3.8
  TCH_Wait_Chunk_Request State
On entry to the TCH_Wait_Chunk_Request state the Chunked Tx State Machine Shall:

Increment Chunk Number to Send.

Start ChunkSenderRequestTimer.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Report_Error state when: 

A Chunk Request has been received and the Chunk Number does not equal Chunk Number to Send or

ChunkSenderRequestTimer has expired and Chunk Number is greater than zero.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Message_Sent state when: 

ChunkSenderRequestTimer has expired and Chunk Number equals zero.
Note:
This is the mechanism which allows the remote Port Partner or Cable Plug to omit the Chunking Layer. 
The Policy Engine will receive a Message Sent signal if the remote Port Partner or Cable Plug is present 
(GoodCRC Message received) but does not send a Chunk Request. After this the remote Port Partner will 
send a Not_Supported Message, or the Cable Plug will Ignore the Chunked Message.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Message_Received state when: 

Any other Message than Chunk Request is received.
6.12.2.1.3.9
  TCH_Message_Received State
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall enter the TCH_Message_Received state:

When any Message is received, and the Chunked Tx State Machine is not in the 
TCH_Wait_Chunk_Request state.
On entry to the TCH_Message_Received state the Chunked Tx State Machine Shall:

Clear the Extended Message Buffers.

Pass the received Message to Chunked Rx Engine.
The Chunked Tx State Machine Shall transition to the TCH_Wait_For_Message_Request_From_Policy_Engine state 
when: 

The received Message has been passed to the Chunked Rx Engine.
6.12.2.1.3.10
  TCH_Report_Error State
On entry to the TCH_Report_Error state the Chunked Tx State Machine Shall:

Report the error to the Policy Engine.
