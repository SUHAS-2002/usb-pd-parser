  Vendor ID (VID) Field
The VID field Shall contain the 16-bit Vendor ID (VID) assigned to the Source's vendor by the USB-IF. If the vendor 
does not have a VID, the VID field Shall be set to 0xFFFF. Devices that have a USB data interface Shall report the 
same VID as the idVendor in the Standard Device Descriptor (see [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2]).
