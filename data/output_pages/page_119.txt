Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Page 119
2)
The Cable Plug responds with a Discover Identity ACK setting the Specification Revision field in the 
Message to the highest Revision of the Power Delivery Specification the VCONN Source supports that is 
equal to or lower than the Specification Revision it received from the Source Port.
3)
The Cable Plug and VCONN Source Shall communicate using the lower of the two revisions until an 
Explicit Contract has been established.
4)
Table 6.2, "Revision Interoperability during an Explicit Contract" shows the Specification Revision that 
Shall be used between the Port Partners and the Cable Plugs when the Specification Revision has been 
discovered and an Explicit Contract is in place.
Notes:

A VCONN Source that does not communicate with the Cable Plug(s) May skip the above procedure.

When a Cable Plug does not respond to a Revision 3.x Discover Identity REQ with a Discover Identity 
ACK or BUSY the VCONN Source May repeat steps 1-4 using a Revision 2.0 Discover Identity REQ in step 
1 before establishing that there is no Cable Plug to communicate with.
A VCONN Source that supports Revision 3.x of the Power Delivery Specification May communicate with a Cable Plug 
also supporting Revision 3.x using Revision 3.x Compliant Communications regardless of the Specification Revision 
of its Port Partner while no Explicit Contract exists. After an Explicit Contract has been established the Port Partners 
and Cable Plug(s) Shall use Table 6.2, "Revision Interoperability during an Explicit Contract" to determine the 
Revision to be used.
All data in all Messages Shall be consistent with the Specification Revision field in the Message Header for that 
particular Message.
A Cable Plug Shall Not save the state of the agreed Specification Revision. A Cable Plug Shall respond with the 
highest Specification Revision it supports that is equal to or lower than the Specification Revision contained in the 
Message received from the VCONN Source.
Cable Plugs Shall operate using the same Specification Revision for both SOP’ and SOP’’. Cable assemblies with two 
Cable Plugs Shall operate using the same Specification Revision for both Cable Plugs.
See Table 6.2, "Revision Interoperability during an Explicit Contract" for details of how various Revisions Shall 
inter-operate.
