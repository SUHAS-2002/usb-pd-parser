  Sink Port Get Source PPS Status State Diagram
Figure 8.152, "Sink Port Get Source PPS Status State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a Sink on receiving a 
request from the Device Policy Manager to get the Port Partner's Source status when operating as a PPS. See also 
Section 6.5.10, "PPS_Status Message".

  PE_SNK_Get_PPS_Status State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Get_PPS_Status state, from the PE_SNK_Ready state, due to a 
request to get the remote Source PPS status from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_SNK_Get_PPS_Status state the Policy Engine Shall send a Get_PPS_Status Message and initialize 
and run the SenderResponseTimer.
On exit from the PE_SNK_Get_PPS_Status state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of the 
outcome (status or response timeout).
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SNK_Ready state (see Figure 8.133, "Sink Port State Diagram") 
when:

A PPS_Status Message is received

Or SenderResponseTimer times out.
