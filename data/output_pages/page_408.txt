tSrcTransient
The maximum time for 
the Source output 
voltage to be between 
vSrcNew and 
vSrcValid in response 
to a load transient 
when target load is 
greater or equal to 
than 60mA.

tSrcTransition
The time the Source 
Shall wait before 
transitioning the 
power supply to 
ensure that the Sink 
has sufficient time to 
prepare (does not
