  Dual-Role Sink Get Sink EPR Capabilities from a Dual-Role 
Source
Figure 8.71, "Dual-Role Sink Gets Dual-Role Source's Capabilities as an EPR Sink" shows an example sequence 
between a Dual-Role Power Source and a Dual-Role Power Sink when the Dual-Role Power Sink gets the Dual-Role 
Power Source Capabilities as a Sink.
