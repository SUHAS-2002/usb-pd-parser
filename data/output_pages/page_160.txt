
Process reception of a BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object that Shall cause the UUT to exit 
the BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode.
When a Port receives a BIST Message BIST Data Object for a BIST Mode when not operating at vSafe5V, the BIST 
Message Shall be Ignored.
When a Port receives a BIST Message BIST Data Object for a BIST Mode it does not support the BIST Message Shall 
be Ignored.
When a Port or Cable Plug receives a BIST Message BIST Data Object for a Continuous BIST Mode the Port or Cable 
Plug enters the requested BIST Mode and Shall remain in that BIST Mode for tBISTContMode and then Shall return 
to normal operation (see Section 6.6.7.2, "BISTContModeTimer").
The usage model of the PHY Layer BIST Modes generally assumes that some controlling agent will request a test of 
its Port Partner.
In Section 8.3.2.15, "Built in Self-Test (BIST)" there is a sequence description of the test sequences used for 
compliance testing.
The fields in the BIST Data Object are defined in the Table 6.27, "BIST Data Object".
6.4.3.1
  BIST Carrier Mode
Upon receipt of a BIST Message, with a BIST Carrier Mode BIST Data Object, the UUT Shall send out a continuous 
string of BMC encoded alternating "1"s and "0"s.
The UUT Shall exit the Continuous BIST Mode within tBISTContMode of this Continuous BIST Mode being enabled 
(see Section 6.6.7.2, "BISTContModeTimer").
6.4.3.2
  BIST Test Data Mode
Upon receipt of a BIST Message, with a BIST Test Data BIST Data Object, the UUT Shall return a GoodCRC Message 
and Shall enter BIST Test Data Mode in which it sends no further Messages except for GoodCRC Messages in 
response to received Messages. See Section 5.9.2, "BIST Test Data Mode" for the definition of the Test Frame.
The test Shall be ended by sending Hard Reset Signaling to reset the UUT.
