  Dual-Role Source Gets Source Capabilities Extended from a Dual-
Role Sink
Figure 8.73, "Dual-Role Source Gets Dual-Role Sink's Extended Capabilities" shows an example sequence between a 
Source and a Sink when the Dual-Role Power Source gets the Dual-Role Power Sink's Extended Capabilities as a 
Source.
