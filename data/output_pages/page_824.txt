Conditions listed on state transitions will come from one of three sources and, when there is a conflict, Should be 
serviced in the following order:
1)
Message and related indications passed up to the Policy Engine from the Protocol Layer (Message sent; 
Message received etc.).
2)
Events triggered within the Policy Engine e.g., timer timeouts.
3)
Information and requests coming from the Device Policy Manager relating either to Local Policy, or to 
other modules which the Device Policy Manager controls such as power supply and USB-C® Port Control.
Note:
The following state diagrams are not intended to cover all possible corner cases that could be 
encountered. For example, where an outgoing Message is Discarded, due to an incoming Message by the 
Protocol Layer (see Section 6.12.2.3, "Protocol Layer Message Reception") it will be necessary for the 
higher layers of the system to handle a retry of the AMS that was being initiated, after first handling the 
incoming Message.
