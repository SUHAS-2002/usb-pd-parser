  Bi-phase Mark Coding (BMC) Signaling Scheme
Bi-phase Mark Coding (BMC) is the PHY Layer Signaling Scheme for carrying USB Power Delivery Messages. This 
encoding assumes a dedicated DC connection, over the CC wire, which is used for sending PD Messages.
Bi-phase Mark Coding is a version of Manchester coding (see [IEC 60958-1]). In BMC, there is a transition at the 
start of every bit time (UI) and there is a second transition in the middle of the UI when a 1 is transmitted. BMC is 
effectively DC balanced, (each 1 is DC balanced and two successive zeros are DC balanced, regardless of the number 
of intervening 1's). It has bounded disparity (limited to 1 bit over an arbitrary Packet, so a very low DC level). 
Figure 5.7, "BMC Example" illustrates Bi-phase Mark Coding. This example shows the transition from a Preamble to 
the Sync-1 K-codes of the SOP Ordered Set at the start of a Message. 
Note:
Other K-codes can occur after the Preamble for Signaling such as Hard Reset and Cable Reset.

  Encoding and signaling
BMC uses DC coupled baseband Signaling on CC. Figure 5.8, "BMC Transmitter Block Diagram" shows a block 
diagram for a Transmitter and Figure 5.9, "BMC Receiver Block Diagram" shows a block diagram for the 
corresponding Receiver.
