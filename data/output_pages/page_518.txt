Table 8.54, "Steps for a DFP Receiving a Data Reset where the DFP is the VCONNSource" below provides a detailed 
explanation of what happens at each labeled step in FFigure 8.27, "DFP Receives Data Reset where the DFP is the 
VCONN Source" above.
Table 8.54  Steps for a DFP Receiving a Data Reset where the DFP is the VCONNSource
Step
UFP (Reset Initiator)
DFP/VCONN Source (Reset Responder)
1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a Data_Reset Message to request a Data Reset. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Data_Reset 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Data_Reset Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Data_Reset Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Data_Reset 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
The Policy Engine informs the DPM that a Data_Reset 
Message has been received.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Data_Reset Message was successfully sent. Policy 
Engine starts SenderResponseTimer. 
10
Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form an Accept 
Message.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
13
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
14
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Accept 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
The Policy Engine stops the SenderResponseTimer.
The DPM proceeds to cycle VCONN and then reset the 
data connection.
15
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
