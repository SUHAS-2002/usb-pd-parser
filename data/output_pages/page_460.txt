14
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
15
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
16
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. The Protocol Layer verifies and 
increments the MessageIDCounter and stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
17
The Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that an 
Accept Message was successfully sent.
Power supply Adjusts its Output to the Negotiated Value
18
The DPM informs the Policy Engine that the power 
supply has settled at the new operating condition and 
tells the Protocol Layer to send a PS_RDY Message.
19
The Protocol Layer forms the PS_RDY Message.
20
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the PS_RDY Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
21
PHY Layer forwards the PS_RDY Message to the Protocol 
Layer.
22
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that a RS_RDY 
has been received. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSTransitionTimer.
When in SPR PPS Mode the Policy Engine starts the 
SinkPPSPeriodicTimer.
23
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
24
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
25
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. The Protocol Layer verifies and 
increments the MessageIDCounter. Stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
 
26
The Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent.
27
When in SPR PPS Mode the Policy Engine starts the 
SourcePPSCommTimer.
