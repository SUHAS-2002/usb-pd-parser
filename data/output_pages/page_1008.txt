10.2.3.3
  Optional Normative Extended Power Range (EPR)
Support of EPR Mode is Optional. An EPR Capable port has a PDP Rating that is >100W and ≤ 240W. An EPR Capable 
Source Port (EPR Source Port) May operate in either SPR Mode or EPR Mode when operating at 100W or less.
An EPR Source Port operating in SPR Mode May offer less than 100W to avoid violating safety regulations. When 
operating in EPR Mode, an EPR Source Port Shall offer 100W in Fixed 20V when not constrained by multi- port 
sharing limits.
An EPR Source May include multiple ports and these ports can be functionally implemented as Shared Capacity 
Charger or Assured Capacity Charger ports as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
Any port on an EPR Source that has a Port Present PDP of 100W or less Shall follow the Normative requirements 
for SPR Source Ports and Shall operate only in SPR Mode. Any port on an EPR Source that is operating with a cable 
that is not EPR Capable Shall operate only in SPR Mode. An EPR Source, when operating in SPR Mode with a 5A cable, 
May offer less than 5A due to design tolerances in order to meet applicable safety standards. For best user 
experience it Should be as close to 100W as possible.
Table 10.12, "EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR Capable Cable" and 
Table 10.13, "EPR Source Capabilities when Port Present PDP is less than Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR-
capable cable" define the Normative requirements EPR Source Ports. While not included in these tables, any EPR 
Source Port that also supports SPR PPS Shall offer the SPR Fixed 20V PDO and PPS 20V Prog APDO at 100W (or the 
maximum available PDP when the port is operating at an Equivalent PDP <100W) when in EPR Mode:

When an EPR Source Port is capable of supplying its PDP Rating, it Shall adhere to the requirements 
defined in Table 10.12, "EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR 
Capable Cable" based on its PDP Rating of x Watts. 

When a Source Port on an EPR Charger is unable to provide its Port Maximum PDP, it Shall adhere to 
the requirements defined in Table 10.13, "EPR Source Capabilities when Port Present PDP is less than 
Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR-capable cable" based on a Port Present PDP of x Watts. Some 
examples:

An EPR Source Port May be unable to provide its PDP Rating because it is thermally constrained at 
the time of power Negotiation.

A Shared port on a multi-port EPR Charger that is limited by the remaining available power.

When an EPR Charger is in an Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Explicit Contract: 

It Shall Reject all Requests outside of the defined voltage range (see Table 10.15, "EPR Adjustable 
Voltage Supply (AVS) Voltage Ranges") or for a requested voltage and Current that results in a power 
level that is more than the Port's Advertised PDP.

In no case Shall a Source Advertise a Current or accept a Current requested by a Sink that exceeds the 
Attached cable's current rating.
