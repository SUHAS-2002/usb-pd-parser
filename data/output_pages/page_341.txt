  Examples of changes from one (A)PDO to another (A)PDO
The seven examples of (A)PDO change transitions below illustrate the most common transitions.
7.3.1.1.1.1
  Increasing the Voltage
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when changing from 
one (A)PDO to another while increasing the voltage is shown in Figure 7.22, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the 
Voltage". The sequence that Shall be followed is described in Table 7.1, "Sequence Description for Increasing the 
Voltage". The timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", 
Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.22, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Voltage", the Sink has previously sent a Request 
Message to the Source.
