  PDUSB Device Enumeration
As described earlier, a PDUSB Device acts as a self-powered device with some caveats with respect to how it 
transitions from the USB Attached State to USB Powered State. Figure 9.9, "Enumeration of a PDUSB Device" gives a 
high-level overview of the enumeration steps involved due to this change. A PDUSB Device will first (Step1) interact 
with the Power Delivery hardware and the Local Policy manager to determine whether or not it can get sufficient 
power to enumerate/operate.
PD is likely to have established a Explicit Contract prior to enumeration. The SPM will be notified (Step 2) of the 
result of this Negotiation between the Power Delivery hardware and the PDUSB Device. After successfully 
negotiating a mutually agreeable Explicit Contract the device will signal a connect to the xHC. The standard USB 
enumeration process (Steps 3, 4 and 5) is then followed to load the appropriate driver for the function(s) that the 
PDUSB Device exposes.
Figure 9.9 Enumeration of a PDUSB Device
If a PDUSB Device cannot perform its intended function with the amount of power that it can get from the Port it is 
connected to, then the host system Should display a notification (on a PD aware OS) about the failure to provide 
sufficient power to the device. In addition, the device Shall follow the requirements listed in Section 8.2.5.2.1, "Local 
device handling of mismatch".
