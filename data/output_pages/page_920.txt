Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or 
PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Discover_Cable state when:

A Reject Message is received or

A Wait Message is received or

The SenderResponseTimer times out.
The Policy Engine May transition to the PE_VCS_Force_VCONN state when:

A Not_Supported Message is received and

The Port is not presently the VCONN Source.
8.3.3.20.2
  PE_VCS_Evaluate_Swap State
The PE_VCS_Evaluate_Swap state is entered from either the PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready state when the 
Policy Engine receives a VCONN_Swap Message.
On entry to the PE_VCS_Evaluate_Swap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager for an 
evaluation of the VCONN Swap request.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_VCS_Accept_Swap state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that a VCONN Swap is OK.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_VCS_Reject_Swap state when:

The Port is not presently the VCONN Source and the Device Policy Manager indicates that a VCONN Swap 
is not OK or

The Device Policy Manager indicates that a VCONN Swap cannot be done at this time.
8.3.3.20.3
  PE_VCS_Accept_Swap State
On entry to the PE_VCS_Accept_Swap state the Policy Engine Shall send an Accept Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_VCS_Wait_For_VCONN state when:

The Accept Message has been sent and

The Port's VCONN is on.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_VCS_Turn_On_VCONN state when:

The Accept Message has been sent and

The Port's VCONN is off.
8.3.3.20.4
  PE_VCS_Reject_Swap State
On entry to the PE_VCS_Reject_Swap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send:

A Reject Message if the device is unable to perform a VCONN Swap at this time.

A Wait Message if further evaluation of the VCONN Swap request is required.
Note:
In this case it is expected that the Port will send a VCONN_Swap Message at a later time.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or 
PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Discover_Cable state when:

The Reject or Wait Message has been sent.
