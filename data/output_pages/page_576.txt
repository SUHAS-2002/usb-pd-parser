  Data Role Swap, Initiated by UFP Operating as Source (Reject)
Figure 8.44, "Rejected Data Role Swap, UFP operating as Source initiates" shows an example sequence between a 
Port, which is initially a UFP (Device) and a Source (Rp asserted), and a Port which is initially a DFP (Host) and a Sink 
(Rd asserted). A Data Role Swap is initiated by the UFP. During the process the Port Partners maintain their 
operation as either a Source or a Sink (power and Rp/Rd remain constant) and the exchange of Data Roles is 
rejected.
