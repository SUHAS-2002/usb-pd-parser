  PPS_Status Message
The PPS_Status Message Shall be sent in response to a Get_PPS_Status Message. The PPS_Status Message enables 
a Sink to query the Source to get additional information about its operational state. The Get_PPS_Status Message 
and the PPS_Status Message Shall only be supported when the Alert Message is also supported.
The PPS_Status Message Shall return a 4-byte PPS Status Data Block (PPSSDB) whose format Shall be as shown in 
Figure 6.49, "PPS_Status Message" and Table 6.62, "PPS Status Data Block (PPSSDB)".

6.5.10.1
  Output Voltage Field
The Output Voltage field Shall return the Source's output voltage at the time of the request. The output voltage is 
measured either at the Source's receptacle or, if the Source has a captive cable, where the voltage is applied to the 
cable.
The measurement accuracy Shall be +/-3% rounded to the nearest 20mV in SPR PPS Mode.
If the Source does not support the Output Voltage field, the field Shall be set to 0xFFFF.
6.5.10.2
  Output Current Field
The Output Current field Shall return the Source's output current at the time of the request measured at the 
Source's receptacle. 
The measurement accuracy Shall be +/-150mA. 
If the Source does not support the Output Current field, the field Shall be set to 0xFF.
