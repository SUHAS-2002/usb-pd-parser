Table 8.138, "Steps for DFP to UFP Enter Mode" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at each 
labeled step in Figure 8.111, "DFP to UFP Enter Mode" above.
Table 8.138  Steps for DFP to UFP Enter Mode
Step
DFP
UFP
1
The DFP has an Explicit Contract 
The DFP has discovered the supported SVIDS using the 
Discover SVIDs Command request and the supported 
Modes using the Discover Modes Command request
The DFP goes to USB Safe State. The DPM requests the 
Policy Engine to enter a Mode.
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to send an 
Enter Mode Command request.
The UFP has an Explicit Contract.
2
Protocol Layer creates the Enter Mode Command 
request and passes to PHY Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Enter Mode 
Command request. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Enter Mode Command request 
and checks the CRC to verify the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the Enter 
Mode Command request to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Enter Mode 
Command request information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and checks 
the CRC to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Enter Mode Command request was successfully sent.
Policy Engine starts the VDMModeEntryTimer.
10
Policy Engine requests the DPM to enter the new 
Mode. The Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to 
form an Enter Mode Command ACK response.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Enter Mode Command ACK 
response and passes to PHY Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the Enter Mode Command ACK 
response and compares the CRC it calculated with the 
one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Enter Mode 
Command ACK response. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
13
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Enter Mode 
Command ACK response information to the Policy 
Engine that consumes it.
14
The Policy Engine stops the VDMModeEntryTimer 
and requests the DPM to enter the new Mode.
