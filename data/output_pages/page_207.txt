
The Source Shall verify the cable is EPR Capable.

A Sink Shall Not be Connected to the Source through a Charge Through VPD (CT-VPD).

The Source and Sink Shall already be in an SPR Explicit Contract.

The EPR Capable bit Shall be set in the Fixed Supply 5V PDO.

The EPR Capable bit Shall have been set in the RDO in the last Request Message received by the Source.
To verify the cable is EPR Capable, the EPR Source Shall have already done the following (see Section 6.6.21.4, 
"tEPRSourceCableDiscovery"):

Discover the cable prior to entering its First Explicit Contract

Alternatively, within tEPRSourceCableDiscovery of entry into the First Explicit Contract

If it is the VCONN Source, discover the cable. 

If not the VCONN Source, do a VCONN Swap then discover the cable.
 and can verify the cable is EPR Capable by completing steps 5 and 6 in the entry process in Figure 6.34, "Illustration 
of process to enter EPR Mode".
The EPR Mode entry process is a Non-interruptible multi-Message AMS. An illustration of this AMS is shown in 
Figure 6.34, "Illustration of process to enter EPR Mode". 
Note:
Figure 6.34, "Illustration of process to enter EPR Mode" is not Normative but is Informative only.
