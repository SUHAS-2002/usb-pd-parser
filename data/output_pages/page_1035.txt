Figure D.6 Output of Finite Difference in dash line and Edge Detector in solid line
The duty cycle of the output signal from the edge detector varies depending on the thresholds, Vth, H and Vth, L, as 
well as jitter and noise from silicon and channel. The techniques such as integrating receiver can be used to recover 
the BMC signal.

  Noise Zone and Detection Zone 
Figure D.7, "Noise Zone and Detect Zone of BMC Receiver" shows the output of Finite Difference when the time 
interval of Finite Difference is set to 300ns. The noise Zone is defined in between +Vnoise and -Vnoise, in which the 
noise glitches occur. The detect zone is defined in between +Vdetect and -Vdetect, excluding the noise zone. The 
thresholds of the edge detectors, Vth, H and Vth, L, must be properly set within the detect zone so that the data can 
be recovered successfully. 
In this example, Vdetect is 250mV and Vnoise is 50mV. It is highly recommended that the product implemented 
with the similar techniques indicates the performance with the range of Vnoise and Vdetect in the electrical 
specification.
