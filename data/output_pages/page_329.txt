   Source Capabilities Extended Parameters
Implementers can choose to make available certain characteristics of a PDUSB Source as a set of Static and/or 
dynamic parameters to improve interoperability between external power sources and portable computing 
devices. The complete list of reportable Static parameters is described in full in Section 6.5.1, 
"Source_Capabilities_Extended Message" and listed in Figure 6.37, "Source_Capabilities_Extended Message". The 
subset of parameters listed below directly represent Source Capabilities and are described in the rest of this 
section.



7.1.12.1
  Voltage Regulation Field
The power consumption of a device can change dynamically. The ability of the Source to regulate its voltage output 
might be important if the device is sensitive to fluctuations in voltage. The Voltage Regulation bit field is used to 
convey information about the Sources output regulation and tolerance to various load steps.
7.1.12.1.1
  Load Step Slew Rate
The default load step slew rate is established at 150mA/µs. A Source Shall meet the following requirements under 
the load step reported in the Source_Capabilities_Extended Message:

The Source Shall maintain VBUS regulation within the vSrcValid range.

The noise on the CC line Shall remain below vNoiseIdle and vNoiseActive.
