Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
6.5.13.1
  Vendor ID (VID) Field
The VID field Shall contain the 16-bit Vendor ID (VID) assigned to the Sink's vendor by the USB-IF. If the vendor 
does not have a VID, the VID field Shall be set to 0xFFFF. Devices that have a USB data interface Shall report the 
same VID as the idVendor in the Standard Device Descriptor (see [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2]).
6.5.13.2
  Product ID (PID) Field
The PID field Shall contain the 16-bit Product ID (PID) assigned by the Sink's vendor. Devices that have a USB data 
interface Shall report the same PID as the idProduct in the Standard Device Descriptor (see [USB 2.0] and [USB 
3.2]).
