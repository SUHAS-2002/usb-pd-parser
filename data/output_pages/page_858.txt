  Sink Port Get Source Capabilities Extended State Diagram
Figure 8.144, "Sink Port Get Source Capabilities Extended State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a Sink on 
receiving a request from the Device Policy Manager to get the Port Partner's extended Source Capabilities. See also 
Section 6.5.1, "Source_Capabilities_Extended Message".

  PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap_Ext State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state, from the PE_SNK_Ready state, due to 
a request to get the remote extended Source Capabilities from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall send a Get_Source_Cap_Extended 
Message and initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
On exit from the PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of the 
outcome (capabilities or response timeout).
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SNK_Ready state (see Figure 8.133, "Sink Port State Diagram") 
when:

A Source_Capabilities_Extended Message is received

Or SenderResponseTimer times out.
