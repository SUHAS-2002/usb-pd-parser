6.12.2.3.2
  PRL_Rx_Layer_Reset_for_Receive state
On entry to the PRL_Rx_Layer_Reset_for_Receive state the Protocol Layer Shall reset the MessageIDCounter and 
clear the stored MessageID. The Protocol Layer Shall transition Protocol Layer Message transmission to the 
PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state (see Section 6.12.2.2.1.2, "PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request State").
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Send_GoodCRC State when:

The Soft Reset actions in this state have been completed.
6.12.2.3.3
  PRL_Rx_Send_GoodCRC state
On entry to the PRL_Rx_Send_GoodCRC state the Protocol Layer Shall construct a GoodCRC Message and request 
the PHY Layer to transmit it.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Check_MessageID state when:

The GoodCRC Message has been passed to the PHY Layer.
When the PHY Layer indicates that a Message has been Discarded due to CC being busy but CC is now Idle (see 
Section 5.7, "Collision Avoidance"), the Protocol Layer Shall either:

Transition to the PRL_Rx_Check_MessageID state or

Transition to the PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state.
6.12.2.3.4
  PRL_Rx_Check_MessageID state
On entry to the PRL_Rx_Check_MessageID state the Protocol Layer Shall compare the MessageID of the received 
Message with its stored value if a value has previously been stored. 
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state when:

The MessageID of the received Message equals the stored MessageID value since this is a Message retry 
which Shall be Discarded.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Store_MessageID state when:

The MessageID of the received Message does not equal the stored MessageID value since this is a new 
Message or

This is the first received Message and no MessageID value is currently stored.
6.12.2.3.5
  PRL_Rx_Store_MessageID state
On entry to the PRL_Rx_Store_MessageID state the Protocol Layer Shall transition Protocol Layer Message 
transmission to the PRL_Tx_Discard_Message state, replace the stored value of MessageID with the value of 
MessageID in the received Message and pass the Message up to the Policy Engine.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state when:

The Message has been passed up to the Policy Engine.
6.12.2.4
  Hard Reset operation
Figure 6.57, "Outline of States" shows the state behavior for the Protocol Layer when receiving a Hard Reset or Cable 
Reset request from the Policy Engine or Hard Reset Signaling or Cable Reset Signaling from the PHY Layer (see also 
Section 6.8.3, "Hard Reset" and Section 6.8.4, "Cable Reset").
