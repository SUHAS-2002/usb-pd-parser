  Cable Plugs

Cable Plugs are powered when VCONN is present but are not aware of the status of the Contract between 
the ports the cable assembly is connecting.

Cable Plugs do not initiate AMSs and only respond to Messages sent to them.

Detach or Communications Failure:

Communications can be interrupted at any time.

There is no communication timeout scheme between the DFP/UFP and Cable Plug. 

The Cable Plug is ready to respond to potentially repeated requests.

Error handling:

The Cable Plug detects Hard Reset Signaling to determine that the Source and Sink have been reset 
and will need to reset itself (equivalent to a power cycle).

The Cable Plug cannot generate Hard Reset Signaling itself.

The Hard Reset process power cycles both VBUS and VCONN so this is expected to reset the Cable 
Plugs by itself.

A Cable Plug detects Cable Reset Signaling to determine that it will need to reset itself (equivalent to a 
power cycle).
