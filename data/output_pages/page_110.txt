5.8.6
  BMC Receiver Specifications
The receiver Shall meet the specifications defined in Table 5.19, "BMC Receiver Normative Requirements".
5.8.6.1
  Definition of Idle
BMC Collision Avoidance is performed by the detection of signal transitions at the receiver. Detection is active when 
nTransitionCount transitions occur at the receiver within a time window of tTransitionWindow. After waiting 
tTransitionWindow without detecting nTransitionCount transitions the bus Shall be declared Idle.
Refer to Section 5.8.5.4, "Inter-Frame Gap" for details of when transmissions May start.
