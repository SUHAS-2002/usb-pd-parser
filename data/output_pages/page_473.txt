  Entering EPR Mode (Failure due to non-EPR cable)
This is an example of an Enter EPR Mode operation where the Sink requests EPR Mode when this process fails due 
to the cable not being capable of EPR. Figure 8.13, "Entering EPR Mode (Failure due to non-EPR cable)" shows the 
Messages as they flow across the bus and within the devices to accomplish the Enter EPR process.
