  Mapping to USB Device States
As mentioned in Section 9.1, "Overview" a PDUSB Device reports itself as a self-powered device. However, the device 
Shall determine whether or not it is in the USB Attached State or USB Powered States as described in Figure 9.4, 
"USB Attached to USB Powered State Transition", Figure 9.5, "Any USB State to USB Attached State Transition (When 
operating as a Consumer)" and Figure 9.6, "Any USB State to USB Attached State Transition (When operating as a 
Provider)" All other USB states of the PDUSB Device Shall be as described in Chapter 9 of [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2].
Figure 9.4, "USB Attached to USB Powered State Transition" shows how a PDUSB Device determines when to 
transition from the USB Attached State to the USB Powered State. USB Type-C Dead Battery operation does not 
require special handling since the default state at Attach or after a Hard Reset is that the USB Device is a Sink. 
Figure 9.4 USB Attached to USB Powered State Transition
Figure 9.5, "Any USB State to USB Attached State Transition (When operating as a Consumer)" shows how a PDUSB 
Device determines when to transition from the USB Powered State to the USB Attached State when the device is a 
Consumer. A PDUSB Device determines that it is performing a Power Role Swap as described in Section 8.3.3.19.3, 
"Policy Engine in Source to Sink Power Role Swap State Diagram" and Section 8.3.3.19.4, "Policy Engine in Sink to 
Source Power Role Swap State Diagram". See Section 7.1.5, "Response to Hard Resets" for additional information on 
device behavior during Hard Resets.
