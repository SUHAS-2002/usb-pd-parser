
Errors during power transitions will automatically lead to a Hard Reset to restore power to default 
levels.

Error handling:

Protocol Errors are handled by a Soft_Reset Message issued by either Port Partner, that resets 
counters, timers and states, but does not change the Negotiate voltage and current or the Port's role 
(e.g., Sink, DFP/UFP, VCONN Source) and does not cause an exit from Modal Operation.

Serious errors are handled by Hard Reset Signaling issued by either Port Partner. A Hard Reset: 

resets protocol as for a Soft Reset but also returns the power supply to USB Default Operation 
(vSafe0V or vSafe5V output) in order to protect the Sink.

restores the Port's Data Role to UFP.

when the Sink is the VCONN Source it removes VCONN then the Source Port is restored as the VCONN 
Source.

causes all Active Modes to be exited such that the Source is no longer in Modal Operation.

After a Hard Reset it is expected that the Port Partner will respond within tTypeCSinkWaitCap. If this 
does not occur, then two further Hard Resets are carried out before the UFP stays in the 
PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state.
