  Exit Mode Command response
The Responder that receives the Exit Mode Command request sends a Message Header with the Number of Data 
Objects field set to a value of 1 followed by a VDM Header with the Command Type (B7…6) set to 1 indicating the 
Command is from a Responder and the Command (B4…0) set to 5 indicating the Responder has exited the Mode and 
has returned to normal USB operation.
