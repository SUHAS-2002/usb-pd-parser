Figure 7.5  PPS Negative Voltage Transitions
Section 7.1.14, "Non-application of VBUS Slew Rate Limits" lists transitions that are exempt from the vPpsSlewNeg 
and vPpsSlewPos limits.
See Section 7.1.8.1, "AVS/PPS Output Voltage Ripple" for output voltage ripple limits.
See Section 7.1.8.2, "AVS/PPS DNL Errors and Output Voltage/Current Tolerance" for output voltage and current 
DNL step adjustments.

   SPR Programmable Power Supply Current Limit
The Programmable Power Supply operating in SPR PPS Mode Shall limit its output current to the Operating 
Current field value in the RDO when the Sink attempts to draw more current than the Operating Current field 
value level. The programming step size for the Operating Current is iPpsCLStep. All programming changes of the 
Operating Current Shall settle to the new Operating Current field value within tPpsCLProgramSettle. The SPR 
PPS Operating Current regulation accuracy during Current Limit is defined as iPpsCLNew. The minimum 
programmable Current Limit level is iPpsCLMin. A Source that supports SPR PPS Mode Shall support Current Limit 
programmability between iPpsCLMin and the Maximum Current value in the SPR PPS APDO. A Source which 
receives a request for current below iPpsCLMin Should reject the request. A Source that accepts a request for 
current below iPpsCLMin Shall set its current limit at 1A.
The response of an SPR PPS to a load change depends on the Operating mode of the SPR PPS and the magnitude of 
the load change. These dependencies lead to one of four possible responses of an SPR PPS to any load change. They 
are differentiated by the value of the PPS Status OMF before and after the load change:

If the PPS Status OMF is cleared both before and after the load change, the SPR PPS responds solely by 
maintaining the output voltage. The SPR PPS output voltage Shall remain within vPpsValid range. The 
SPR PPS response to the load change Shall settle within the vPpsNew tolerance band by the time 
tPpsTransient. The Operating Mode Flag Shall remain cleared during the load change response of the 
SPR PPS.

If the PPS Status OMF is cleared before the load change and set after the load change, the SPR PPS 
responds by reducing its output voltage to limit the SPR PPS output current. The SPR PPS output current 
Shall stay within the iPpsCVCLTransient range once it reaches the iPpsCVCLTransient range. The SPR
