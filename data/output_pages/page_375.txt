Step
Source Port
Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to increase its 
set-point for the current limit.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
The Power Supply increases its Current Limit set-
point to the new requested value. 
The Sink draws current according to the increased 
Current Limit of the Source.
4
The Policy Engine waits tPpsSrcTransSmall then 
sends the PS_RDY Message to the Sink starting within 
tPpsCLProgramSettle of the end of the GoodCRC 
Message following the Accept Message.
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message.
5
Policy Engine receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. 
6
Policy Engine then stops the PSTransitionTimer, 
evaluates the PS_RDY Message and tells the Device 
Policy Manager it can increase the current up to the 
requested value without the Source going into CL 
mode.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
7
The Sink increases its current.
