  USB Type-C Referenced States
This section contains states cross-referenced from the [USB Type-C 2.4] specification.
8.3.3.28.1
  ErrorRecovery state
The ErrorRecovery state is used to electronically disconnect Port Partners using the USB Type-C connector. The 
ErrorRecovery state Shall be entered when there are errors on USB Type-C Ports which cannot be recovered by 
Hard Reset. The ErrorRecovery state Shall map to USB Type-C ErrorRecovery state operation as defined in the 
[USB Type-C 2.4] specification. Bus powered Sinks Shall Not be required to meet this requirement as removal of 
their power will serve the same purpose.
On entry to the ErrorRecovery state the Explicit Contract and PD Connection Shall be ended.
On exit from the ErrorRecovery state a new Explicit Contract Should be established once the Port Partners have 
re-connected over the CC wire.
