PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Source_Capabilities Message to the Protocol Layer.
14
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received 
Source_Capabilities Message information to the Policy 
Engine that consumes it.
15
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and checks 
the CRC to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Source_Capabilities Message was successfully sent. 
Policy Engine stops the NoResponseTimer and starts 
the SenderResponseTimer.
USB Power Delivery communication is re-established.
