
Extended Messages of Data Size ≤ MaxExtendedMsgLegacyLen (Chunked flag set to zero or one) Shall 
be retried.

Extended Messages of Data Size > MaxExtendedMsgLegacyLen that are Chunked (Chunked flag set to 
one) individual Chunks Shall be retried.
When Messages are not retried, then the RetryCounter is not used. Higher layer protocols are expected to 
accommodate Message delivery failure or failure to receive a GoodCRC Message.
6.7.3
  Hard Reset Counter
The HardResetCounter is used to retry the Hard Reset whenever there is no response from the remote device (see 
Section 6.6.6, "NoResponseTimer"). Once the Hard Reset has been retried nHardResetCount times then it Shall be 
assumed that the remote device is non-responsive.
6.7.4
  Capabilities Counter
The CapsCounter is used to count the number of Source_Capabilities Messages which have been sent by a Source 
at power up or after a Hard Reset. Implementation of the CapsCounter is Optional but May be used by any Source 
which wishes to preserve power by not sending Source_Capabilities Messages after a period of time. 
When the CapsCounter is implemented and the Source detects that a Sink is Attached then after nCapsCount 
Source_Capabilities Messages have been sent the Source Shall decide that the Sink is non-responsive, stop sending 
Source_Capabilities Messages and disable PD.
A Sink Shall use the SinkWaitCapTimer to trigger the resending of Source_Capabilities Messages by a USB Power 
Delivery capable Source which has previously stopped sending Source_Capabilities Messages. Any Sink which is 
Attached and does not detect a Source_Capabilities Message, Shall issue Hard Reset Signaling when the 
SinkWaitCapTimer times out in order to reset the Source. Resetting the Source Shall also reset the CapsCounter 
and restart the sending of Source_Capabilities Messages.
6.7.5
  Discover Identity Counter
When sending Discover Identity Messages to a Cable Plug a Port Shall maintain a count of Messages sent 
(DiscoverIdentityCounter). No more than nDiscoverIdentityCount Discover Identity Messages Shall be sent by 
the Port without receiving a GoodCRC Message response. A VCONN Swap Shall reset the DiscoverIdentityCounter.
6.7.6
  VDMBusyCounter
When sending Responder BUSY responses to a Structured Vendor_Defined Message a UFP or Cable Plug Shall 
maintain a count of Messages sent (VDMBusyCounter). No more than nBusyCount Responder BUSY responses 
Shall be sent. The VDMBusyCounter Shall be reset on sending a non-BUSY response. Products wishing to meet 
[USB Type-C 2.4] requirements for Alternate Mode entry Should use an nBusyCount of 1.
