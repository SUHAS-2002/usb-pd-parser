6.4.4.3.1.6.1
  HW Version Field
The HW Version (B31…28) contains a HW version assigned by the VID owner.
6.4.4.3.1.6.2
  FW Version Field
The Firmware Version field (B27…24) contains a FW version assigned by the VID owner.
6.4.4.3.1.6.3
  VDO Version Field
The VDO Version field (B23…20) contains a VDO Version for this VDM Version number. This field indicates the 
expected content for this VDO.
6.4.4.3.1.6.4
  USB Type-C plug to USB Type-C/Captive Field
The USB Type-C plug to USB Type-C/Captive (Passive Cable) field (B19…18) Shall contain a value indicating 
whether the opposite end from the USB Type-C plug is another USB Type-C plug (i.e., a detachable Standard USB 
Type-C Cable Assembly) or is a Captive Cable Assembly.
6.4.4.3.1.6.5
  EPR Mode Capable
The EPR Capable (Passive Cable) bit is a Static bit which Shall only be set when the cable is specifically designed 
for safe operation when carrying up to 48 volts at 5 amps.
6.4.4.3.1.6.6
  Cable Latency Field
The Cable Latency (Passive Cable) field (B16…13) Shall contain a value corresponding to the signal latency 
through the cable which can be used as an approximation for its length.
6.4.4.3.1.6.7
  Cable Termination Type Field
The Cable Termination Type (Passive Cable) field (B12…11) Shall contain a value indicating whether the Passive 
Cable needs VCONN only initially in order to support the Discover Identity Command, after which it can be removed, 
or the Passive Cable needs VCONN to be continuously applied in order to power some feature of the Cable Plug.
6.4.4.3.1.6.8
  Maximum VBUS Voltage Field
The Maximum VBUS Voltage (Passive Cable) field (B10…9) Shall contain the maximum voltage that Shall be 
Negotiated using a Fixed Supply over the cable as part of an Explicit Contract where the maximum voltage that Shall 
be applied to the cable is vSrcNew max + vSrcValid max. For example, when the Maximum VBUS Voltage (Passive 
Cable) field is 20V, a Fixed Supply of 20V can be Negotiated as part of an Explicit Contract where the absolute 
maximum voltage that can be applied to the cable is 21.55V. Similarly, when the Maximum VBUS Voltage (Passive
