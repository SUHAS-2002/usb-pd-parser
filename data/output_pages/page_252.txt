6.6.5.1
  PSTransitionTimer
The PSTransitionTimer is used by the Policy Engine to timeout on a PS_RDY Message. It is started when a request 
for new Source Capabilities has been accepted and will timeout after tPSTransition if a PS_RDY Message has not 
been received. This condition leads to a Hard Reset and a return to USB Default Operation. The PSTransitionTimer 
relates to the time taken for the Source to transition from one voltage, or current level, to another (see Section 7.1, 
"Source Requirements").
The PSTransitionTimer Shall be started when the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to an 
Accept Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer. The PSTransitionTimer Shall be stopped when the last 
bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the PS_RDY Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.5.2
  PSSourceOffTimer
6.6.5.2.1
  Use during Power Role Swap
The PSSourceOffTimer is used by the Policy Engine in Dual-Role Power Device that is currently acting as a Sink to 
timeout on a PS_RDY Message during a Power Role Swap AMS. This condition leads to USB Type-C Error Recovery.
If a PR_Swap Message request has been sent by the Dual-Role Power Device currently acting as a Source the Sink can 
respond with an Accept Message. When the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to this transmitted 
Accept Message, is received by the Sink's PHY Layer, then the PSSourceOffTimer Shall be started.
If a PR_Swap Message request has been sent by the Dual-Role Power Device currently acting as a Sink the Source can 
respond with an Accept Message. When the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to this received 
Accept Message, is transmitted by the Sink's PHY Layer, then the PSSourceOffTimer Shall be started.
The PSSourceOffTimer Shall be stopped when the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the 
received PS_RDY Message, is transmitted by the PHY Layer.
The PSSourceOffTimer relates to the time taken for the remote Dual-Role Power Device to stop supplying power 
(see also Section 7.3.2.1, "Sink Requested Power Role Swap" and Section 7.3.2.2, "Source Requested Power Role 
Swap"). The timer Shall time out if a PS_RDY Message has not been received from the remote Dual-Role Power 
Device within tPSSourceOff indicating this has occurred.
6.6.5.2.2
  Use during Fast Role Swap
The PSSourceOffTimer is used by the Policy Engine in Dual-Role Power Device that is the Initial Sink (currently 
providing vSafe5V) to timeout on a PS_RDY Message during a Fast Role Swap AMS. This condition leads to USB 
Type-C Error Recovery.
When the FR_Swap Message request has been sent by the Initial Sink, the Initial Source Shall respond with an 
Accept Message. When the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to this Accept Message is received 
by the Initial Sink's PHY Layer, then the PSSourceOffTimer Shall be started.
The PSSourceOffTimer Shall be stopped when 
the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the received PS_RDY Message, is transmitted by the PHY 
Layer.
The PSSourceOffTimer relates to the time taken for the Initial Source to stop supplying power and for VBUS to 
revert to vSafe5V (see also Section 7.2.10, "Fast Role Swap" and Section 7.3.4, "Transitions Caused by Fast Role 
Swap"). The timer Shall time out if a PS_RDY Message has not been received from the Initial Source within 
tPSSourceOff indicating this has occurred.
6.6.5.3
  PSSourceOnTimer
6.6.5.3.1
  Use during Power Role Swap
The PSSourceOnTimer is used by the Policy Engine in Dual-Role Power Device that has just stopped sourcing power 
and is waiting to start sinking power to timeout on a PS_RDY Message during a Power Role Swap. This condition 
leads to USB Type-C Error Recovery.
