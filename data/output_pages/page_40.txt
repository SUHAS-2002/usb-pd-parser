  Terms and Abbreviations
This section defines terms used throughout this document. For additional terms that pertain to the Universal Serial 
Bus, see Chapter 2, “Terms and Abbreviations,” in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] and [USBBC 1.2].
Table 1.4  Terms and Abbreviations
Term
Description
(A)PDO
Refers to both the PDO and APDO collectively.
AC Supply
AC Supplied
Refers to the main AC power source typically provided to the wall AKA “mains”.
Active Cable
A cable with a USB Type-C plug on each end that incorporates data bus signal conditioning 
circuits. The cable supports the Structured VDM Discover Identity Command to expose its 
characteristics in addition to other Structured VDM Commands (Electronically Marked Cable 
see [USB Type-C 2.4]).
Active Cable VDO
VDO defining the Capabilities of an Active Cable.
Active Mode
A Mode which has been through the Mode Entry process but not the Mode Exit process.
Adjustable Voltage Supply
A power supply whose output voltage can be adjusted to an operating voltage within its 
Advertised range. These Capabilities are exposed by the Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) APDO 
(see Section 6.4.1.2.4, "Augmented Power Data Object (APDO)").
Note: Unlike the SPR PPS, the SPR AVS and EPR AVS do not support current limit.
Advertise
An offer made by a Source in the Source_Capabilities/EPR_Source_Capabilities Message (e.g., 
an APDO or PDO).
Alternate Mode
Operation defined by a Vendor or Standard’s organization, which is associated with a SVID. The 
definition of Alternate Modes is outside the scope of USB-IF specifications. Entry to and exit from 
the Alternate Mode uses the Mode Entry and Mode Exit processes. As defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
Alternate Mode Adapter
A PDUSB Device which supports Alternate Modes as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
Note: Since an AMA is a PDUSB Device, it has a single UFP that is only addressable by SOP 
Packets.
Alternate Mode Controller
A DFP that supports connection to AMAs as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. A DFP that is an AMC 
can also be a PDUSB Host.
AMA
See Alternate Mode Adapter.
AMC
See Alternate Mode Controller.
AMS
See Atomic Message Sequence.
APDO
See Augmented Power Data Object.
Assured Capacity Charger
As defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. This maps to a Charger with one or more Guaranteed Capability 
Ports.
Assured Capacity Group
As defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. This maps to a group of Guaranteed Capability Ports.
Atomic Message Sequence
A fixed sequence of Messages as defined in Section 8.3.2, "Atomic Message Sequence Diagrams" 
typically starting and ending in one of the following states: PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or 
PE_CBL_Ready. An AMS is Non-interruptible.
Attach
Mechanical joining of the Port Pair by a cable.
Attached
USB Power Delivery Ports which are mechanically joined with USB cable.
Attachment
See Attach.
Augmented Power Data 
Object
Data Object used to expose a Source Port's or Sink Port's power Capabilities as part of a 
Source_Capabilities/EPR_Source_Capabilities or Sink_Capabilities/EPR_Sink_Capabilities 
Message respectively. An SPR PPS Data Object, SPR AVS Data Object and EPR AVS Data Object are 
defined.
AVS
See Adjustable Voltage Supply.
AVS Mode
A power supply, currently operating as an AVS, is said to be operating in AVS Mode.
Battery
A power storage device residing behind a Port that can either be a Source or Sink of power.
