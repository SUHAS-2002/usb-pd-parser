  Fixed Supply PDOs
Figure 10.1, "SPR Source Power Rule Illustration for Fixed Supply PDOs" illustrates the minimum current that an SPR 
Source Shall support at each voltage for a given PDP Rating for Fixed Supply PDOs.
Note:
Not illustrated are that currents higher than 3A are allowed to be offered up to a limit of 5A given that a 
5A cable is detected by the Source and the voltage times current remains within the Source PDP Rating.

Figure 10.2, "SPR Source Power Rule Example For Fixed Supply PDOs" shows an example of an adapter with a rating 
at 50W. The adapter is required to support 20V at 2.5A, 15V at 3A, 9V at 3A and 5V at 3A.
