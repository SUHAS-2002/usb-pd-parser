  BIST Carrier Mode
The following is an example of a BIST Carrier Mode test between a Tester and a UUT. When the UUT is connected to 
the Tester the sequence below is executed. 
Figure 8.116, "BIST Carrier Mode Test" shows the Messages as they flow across the bus and within the devices. This 
test enables the measurement of power supply noise and frequency drift.
1)
Connection is established and stable.
2)
Tester sends a BIST Message with a BIST Carrier Mode BIST Data Object.
3)
UUT answers with a GoodCRC Message.
4)
UUT starts sending the Test Pattern.
5)
Operator does the measurements.
6)
The test ends after tBISTContMode.
