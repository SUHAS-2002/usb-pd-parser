  SenderResponseTimer State Diagram
Figure 8.131, "SenderResponseTimer Policy Engine State Diagram" below shows the state diagram for the Policy 
Engine in a Source Port or a Sink Port. The following sections describe operation in each of the states.
Figure 8.131 SenderResponseTimer Policy Engine State Diagram
8.3.3.1.1.1
  SRT_Stopped State
The SRT_Stopped State Shall be the starting state for the SenderResponseTimer either on power up or after a 
Hard Reset. On entry to this state the Policy Engine Shall stop incrementing the SR_Timer. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the SRT_Running State:

When the SenderResponseTimer is started from within a Policy Engine state, or

When a Start_SRT is requested from the Chunking Layer.
8.3.3.1.1.2
  SRT_Running State
On entry to the SRT_Running State the SenderResponseTimer state machine Shall:

Set the SR_Timer to zero

Start running SR_Timer.
The SenderResponseTimer state machine Shall transition to the SRT_Expired State:

When the SR_Timer reaches its maximum count
The SenderResponseTimer state machine Shall transition to the SRT_Stopped State:

When the SenderResponseTimer is stopped by exiting a Policy Engine state, or

When a Stop_SRT is requested from the Chunking Layer
SRT_Stopped
Actions on entry:
Stop Incrementing SR_Timer1
Power-up |
Hard Reset |
SenderResponseTimer stopped on exit from Policy Engine State |
Stop_SRT requested from Chunking Layer
Actions on entry:

The SR_Timer is regarded as the mechanism within the SenderResponseTimer state diagram that implements the SenderResponseTimer.
