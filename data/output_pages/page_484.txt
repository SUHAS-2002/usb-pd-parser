  EPR Explicit Contract Negotiation (Reject)
Figure 8.16, "Rejected Fixed EPR Power Negotiation" illustrates an example of a Message flow where the request is 
rejected while negotiating an Explicit Contract in EPR Mode. The Negotiation goes through several distinct phases:

The Source sends out its power Capabilities in an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message.

The Sink evaluates these Capabilities and, in the request phase, selects one power level by sending an 
EPR_Request Message.

The Source evaluates the request and accepts the request with a Reject Message.
