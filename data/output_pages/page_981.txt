Figure 9.7, "Any USB State to USB Attached State Transition (After a USB Type-C Data Role Swap)" shows how a 
PDUSB Device using the USB Type-C connector determines when to transition from the USB Powered State to the 
USB Attached State after a Data Role Swap has been performed i.e., it has just changed from operation as a PDUSB 
Host to operation as a PDUSB Device. The Data Role Swap is described in Section 6.3.9, "DR_Swap Message". A Hard 
Reset will also return a Sink acting as a PDUSB Host to PDUSB Device operation as described in Section 6.8.3, "Hard 
Reset". See Section 7.1.5, "Response to Hard Resets" for additional information on device behavior during Hard 
Resets.
