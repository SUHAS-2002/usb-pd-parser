Figure 7.17, "VBUS detection and timing during Fast Role Swap, initial VBUS (at new source) > vSafe5V(min)" and 
Figure 7.18, "VBUS detection and timing during Fast Role Swap, initial VBUS (at new source) < vSafe5V(min)" show the 
VBUS detection and timing for the New Source during a Fast Role Swap after the Fast Role Swap Request has been 
received. The New Source May turn on the VBUS output switch once VBUS is below vSafe5V (max). In this case, the 
New Source prevents VBUS from falling below vSafe5V (min). The new source Shall turn on the VBUS output switch 
within tSrcFRSwap of falling below vSafe5V (min).
VBUS might have started at vSafe5V or at higher voltage. When the Fast Role Swap Request is detected, VBUS could 
therefore be either above vSafe5V (max), within the vSafe5V range, or below vSafe5V (min). If the Fast Role Swap 
Request is detected when VBUS is below vSafe5V (min), then the new source Shall turn on the VBUS output switch 
within tSrcFRSwap of detecting the Fast Role Swap Request. In this case, the maximum time from the beginning of 
the Fast Role Swap Request to VBUS being sourced May be tSrcFRSwap (max) + tFRSwapRx (max).

  Non-application of VBUS Slew Rate Limits
Scenarios where vSrcSlewPos and vPpsSlewPos VBUS slew rate limits do not apply and VBUS May transition faster 
than specified are as follows:

When first applying VBUS after an Attach.

When applying VBUS as part of a Power Role Swap to Source Power Role.

When increasing VBUS from vSafe0V to vSafe5V during a Hard Reset.

During a Fast Role Swap when the Initial Sink applies VBUS.
