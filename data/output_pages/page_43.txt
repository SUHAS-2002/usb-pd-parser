Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Page 43
Default Contract
An agreement on current at 5V is reached between a Port Pair based on USB Type-C current 
([USB Type-C 2.4]).
Detach
Mechanical unjoining of the Port Pair by removal of the cable.
Detached
USB Power Delivery Ports which are no longer mechanically joined with USB cable.
Detaches
See Detach.
Device
When lower cased (device), it refers to any USB product, either USB Device or USB Host. When 
in upper case refers to a USB Device (Peripheral or Hub).
Device Policy
Policy applied across multiple Ports in a Source or Sink.
Device Policy Manager
Module running in a Source or Sink that applies Device Policy to each Port in the device, as Local 
Policy, via the Policy Engine.
DFP
See Downstream Facing Port.
DFP VDO
VDO returned by the DFP containing Capabilities.
Differential Non-Linearity
The difference between an ideal LSB step, and the real observable LSB step when the Power 
Source is operating in either PPS or AVS mode. A DNL of 0 indicates that the step is ideal. If DNL 
is positive the step is larger than the ideal LSB, and if it is negative then the step is smaller than 
ideal.
Discovery Process
Command sequence using Structured Vendor Defined Messages resulting in identification of the 
Port Partner and Cable Plug, and their supported SVIDs and Alternate Modes.
DNL
See Differential Non-Linearity.
Downstream Facing Port
Indicates the Port's position in the USB topology which typically corresponds to a USB Host root 
Port or Hub downstream Port as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. At connection, the Port defaults to 
operation as the Source and as a USB Host (when USB Communication is supported).
DPM
See Device Policy Manager.
DRD
See Dual-Role Data.
DRP
See Dual-Role Power.
Dual-Role Data
Capability of operating as either a DFP or UFP.
Dual-Role Data Port
A Port capable of operating as DRD.
Dual-Role Power
Capability of operating as either a Source or Sink.
Dual-Role Power Device
A product containing one or more Dual-Role Power Ports that can operate as either a Source or 
a Sink.
Dual-Role Power Port
A Port capable of operating as a DRP.
EM
See Extended Message.
End of Packet
K-code marker used to delineate the end of a Packet.
EOP
See End of Packet.
EPR
See Extended Power Range.
EPR AVS
A power supply operating in EPR Mode whose output voltage can be adjusted to an operating 
voltage within its Advertised range. Unlike SPR PPS it does not support current limit. The AVS 
Capabilities are exposed by the Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO (see Section 6.4.1.2.4, 
"Augmented Power Data Object (APDO)"). 
EPR AVS Mode
A EPR Source, currently operating in an EPR AVS Contract, is said to be operating in EPR AVS 
Mode.
EPR Cable
A cable which is rated to operate in both SPR Mode and EPR Mode.
EPR Capabilities
The EPR Capabilities Messages (EPR_Source_Capabilities and EPR_Sink_Capabilities) are 
Extended Messages with the first seven positions filled with the same SPR (A)PDOs returned by 
the SPR Capabilities Messages (Source_Capabilities and Sink_Capabilities) followed by the EPR 
(A)PDOs starting in the eighth position.
EPR Capable
A product which has the ability to operate in EPR Mode.
