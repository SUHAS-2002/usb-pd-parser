 FRS System Level Example
E.1
  Overview
Appendix E, "FRS System Level Example" is intended to clarify Fast Role Swap (FRS) functionality at the system level 
through the use of an example implementation. 
Figure E.1, "Example FRS Capable System" is an example of a Hub and laptop implementation that supports Fast Role 
Swap (see Figure 7.16, "VBUS Power during Fast Role Swap"). It is not the only possible Hub or laptop architecture. 
However, it is intended to provide an example system whose functionality is used here to illustrate how Fast Role 
Swap works.
Figure E.1 Example FRS Capable System
This appendix describes two cases that cover a variety of behaviors that might be seen in practice. 

Slow VBUS Discharge where VBUS between the Hub and the laptop takes more than 15ms (tFRSwapInit) 
to discharge below 5.5 V (vSafe5V (max)). In this case the FR_Swap Message is sent by the laptop while 
VBUS is still greater than vSafe5V (max). See Figure E.2, "Slow VBUS Discharge".

Fast VBUS Discharge where VBUS between the Hub and the laptop discharges very quickly, perhaps be-
fore the Fast Role Swap Request is even complete. See Figure E.3, "Fast VBUS Discharge".
However, neither the Hub nor the laptop can anticipate how quickly VBUS will discharge until the power adapter is 
disconnected from an AC Supply or it is unplugged from the Hub.
The Fast Role Swap Request is the momentary low driven by the Hub on the CC wire which is detected by the laptop.
Figure E.2, "Slow VBUS Discharge" and Figure E.3, "Fast VBUS Discharge" show the voltage seen on VBUS in 
relationship to the Fast Role Swap Request They also show the transition between when the Hub stops supplying 
VBUS and when the laptop starts supplying VBUS.
