Every Fixed Supply PDO Shall contain a Peak Current field. Supplies that want to offer a set of overload Capabilities 
Shall Advertise this through the Peak Current field in the corresponding Fixed Supply PDO (see Table 6.10, "Fixed 
Power Source Peak Current Capability"). Supplies that do not support an overload capability Shall set these bits to 
00b in the corresponding Fixed Supply PDO. Supplies that support an extended overload capability specified in the 
PeakCurrent1…3 fields of the Source_Capabilities_Extended Message (see Section 6.5.1, 
"Source_Capabilities_Extended Message") Shall also set these bits to 00b. Sinks wishing to utilize these Extended 
Capabilities Shall first send the Get_Source_Cap_Extended Message to determine what Capabilities, if any are 
supported by the Source.
6.4.1.2.2
  Variable Supply (non-Battery) Power Data Object
Table 6.11, "Variable Supply (non-Battery) PDO – Source" describes a Variable Supply (non-Battery) (10b) PDO for 
a Source. See Section 7.1.3, "Types of Sources" for the electrical requirements of the power supply.
The voltage fields Shall define the range that output voltage Shall fall within. This does not indicate the voltage that 
will be supplied, except it Shall fall within that range. The absolute voltage, including any voltage variation, Shall 
Not fall below the Minimum Voltage field value and Shall Not exceed the Maximum Voltage field value. The 
Minimum Voltage field value Shall Not be less than 80% of the Maximum Voltage field value.
6.4.1.2.3
  Battery Supply Power Data Object 
Table 6.12, "Battery Supply PDO – Source" describes a Battery Supply (01b) PDO for a Source. See Section 7.1.3, 
"Types of Sources" for the electrical requirements of the power supply.
The voltage fields Shall represent the Battery's voltage range. The Battery Shall be capable of supplying the Power 
value over the entire voltage range. The absolute voltage, including any voltage variation, Shall Not fall below the 
Minimum Voltage field value and Shall Not exceed the Maximum Voltage field value.
Note:
The Battery Supply PDO uses power instead of current.
