8.3.3.26.1.2
  PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Ack State
On entry to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Ack state the Policy Engine Shall send a EPR_Mode (Enter 
Acknowledged) Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Evaluate_Cable_EPR state when:

The EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message has been sent and

The Source is not the VCONN Source and

The cable is a captive cable or a known EPR Cable.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_VCS_Send_Swap state when:

The EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message has been sent and

The Source is not the VCONN Source and

The cable is unknown.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Discover_Cable state when:

The EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message has been sent and

The Source is the VCONN Source and

The cable is unknown.
8.3.3.26.1.3
  PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Discover_Cable State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Discover_Cable state from the PE_VCS_Force_VCONN state 
or PE_VCS_Send_Ps_Rdy state when:

A Source initiated VCONN Swap process has completed.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_INIT_PORT_VDM_Identity_Request state in order to perform Cable 
Plug discovery when:

The Source is the VCONN Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Failed state when:

The VCONN Swap process failed (the Source is not the VCONN Source).
8.3.3.26.1.4
  PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Evaluate_Cable_EPR State
In the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Evaluate_Cable_EPR state the Policy Engine requests the DPM to evaluate the Cable 
Discovery results.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Succeeded state when:

The Cable Plug is capable of EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Failed state when:

The Cable Plug is not capable of EPR Mode.
8.3.3.26.1.5
  PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Succeeded State
On entry to the PE_SRC_EPR_Mode_Entry_Succeeded state the Policy Engine Shall send a EPR_Mode (Enter 
Succeeded) Message and enter EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

EPR Mode has been entered.
