
Provider/Consumers not using large external sources ("Unconstrained Powered" bit cleared) Should al-
ways accept a Power Role Swap request from a Consumer/Provider using large external power sources 
("Unconstrained Power" bit set) unless the requester is not able to provide the requirements of the 
present Provider/Consumer.
8.2.7
  Interface to the Policy Engine
The Device Policy Manager Shall maintain an interface to the Policy Engine for each Port in the device.
8.2.7.1
  Device Policy Manager in a Provider
The Device Policy Manager in a Provider Shall also provide the following functions to the Policy Engine:

Inform the Policy Engine of changes in cable/ device Attachment status for a given cable.

Inform the Policy Engine whenever the Source Capabilities available for a Port change.

Evaluate requests from an Attached Consumer and provide responses to the Policy Engine.

Respond to requests for power supply transitions from the Policy Engine.

Indication to Policy Engine when power supply transitions are complete.

Maintain a power reserve for devices operating on a Port at less than maximum power.
8.2.7.2
  Device Policy Manager in a Consumer
The Device Policy Manager in a Consumer Shall also provide the following functions to the Policy Engine:



Inform the Policy Engine whenever the power requirements for a Port change.

Evaluate Source Capabilities and provide suitable responses:

Request from offered Capabilities.

Indicate whether additional power is required.

Respond to requests for Sink transitions from the Policy Engine.
8.2.7.3
  Device Policy Manager in a Dual-Role Power Device
The Device Policy Manager in a Dual-Role Power Device Shall provide the following functions to the Policy Engine:

Provider Device Policy Manager

Consumer Device Policy Manager

Interface for the Policy Engine to request power supply transitions from Source to Sink and vice versa.

Indications to Policy Engine during Power Role Swap transitions.
8.2.7.4
  Device Policy Manager in a Dual-Role Power Device Dead Bat-
tery handling
The Device Policy Manager in a Dual-Role Power Device with a Dead Battery Should:

Switch Ports to Sink-only or Sink DFP operation to obtain power from the next Attached Source.

Use VBUS from the Attached Source to power the USB Power Delivery communications as well as 
charging to enable the Negotiation of higher input power.
