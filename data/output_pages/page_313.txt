within the range defined by the relative tolerance vSrcNew and the absolute band vSrcValid as listed 
in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters" and described in Section 7.1.8, "Output Voltage Tolerance 
and Range".

The Variable Supply (non-Battery) PDO exposes less well-regulated Sources. The output voltage of a 
Variable Supply (non-Battery) Shall remain within the absolute maximum output voltage and the 
absolute minimum output voltage exposed in the Variable Supply PDO.

The Battery Supply PDO exposes Batteries than can be connected directly as a Source to VBUS. The output 
voltage of a Battery Supply Shall remain within the absolute maximum output voltage and the absolute 
minimum output exposed in the Battery Supply PDO.

The Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Augmented Power Data Object (APDO) exposes a Source with 
an output voltage that can be adjusted programmatically over a defined range. The output voltage of 
the Programmable Power Supply Shall remain within a range defined by the relative tolerance 
vPpsNew and the absolute band vPpsValid.

The Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Augmented Power Data Object (APDO) exposes a Source with an 
output voltage that can be adjusted programmatically over a defined range. The output voltage of the 
AVS Shall remain within a range defined by the relative tolerance vAvsNew and the absolute band 
vAvsValid.

  Fixed Supply Positive Voltage Transitions
The Source Shall transition VBUS from the starting voltage to the higher new voltage in a controlled manner. The 
Negotiated new voltage (e.g., 5V, 9V, 15V, …) defines the nominal value for vSrcNew. During the positive transition 
the Source Should be able to supply the Sink Standby current and the transient current to charge the total bulk 
capacitance on VBUS. The slew rate of the positive transition Shall Not exceed vSrcSlewPos. The transitioning 
Source output voltage Shall settle within vSrcNew by tSrcSettle. The Source Shall be able to supply the Negotiated 
power level at the new voltage by tSrcReady. The positive voltage transition Shall remain above vSrcValid min of 
the previous Explicit Contract and below vSrcValid max of the new Explicit Contract (Figure 7.2, "Transition 
Envelope for Positive Voltage Transitions"). The voltage Shall settle to vSrcNew within tSrcSettle. The starting time, 
t0, in Figure 7.2, "Transition Envelope for Positive Voltage Transitions" starts tSrcTransition after the last bit of the 
EOP of the GoodCRC Message has been received by the Source.
Figure 7.2 Transition Envelope for Positive Voltage Transitions
 At the start of the positive voltage transition the VBUS voltage level Shall Not droop vSrcValid min below either 
vSrcNew (i.e., if the starting VBUS voltage level is not vSafe5V) or vSafe5V as applicable.
