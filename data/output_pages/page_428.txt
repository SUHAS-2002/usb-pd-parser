Figure 8.4, "Basic Message Flow with Bad followed by a Retry" illustrates one of these cases; the basic Message flow 
with a retry due to a bad CRC at the Message Receiver. It starts when the Message Sender's Protocol Layer at the 
behest of its Policy Engine forms a Message that it passes to the PHY Layer. The Protocol Layer is responsible for 
retries on a “'n' strikes and you are out" basis (nRetryCount). Table 8.3, "Basic Message Flow with CRC failure" 
details the steps in the flow.

F
1)
GoodCRC Message response does not arrive at the Message Sender side due to the noise on the channel.
2)
GoodCRC Message response arrives but has a bad CRC.
A GoodCRC Message is not received by the Message Sender’s Protocol Layer. This leads to a CRCReceiveTimer 
timeout in the Message Sender.
G
1)
GoodCRC Message is received but does contain the same MessageID as the transmitted Message.
2)
A Message is received but it is not a GoodCRC Message (similar case to that of an unexpected or unknown 
Message but this time detected in the Protocol Layer).
Both of these issues indicate errors in receiving an expected GoodCRC Message which will lead to a 
CRCReceiveTimer timeout in the Protocol Layer and a subsequent retry (except for communications with Cable 
Plugs).
