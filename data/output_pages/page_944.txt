  DFP/VCONN Source SOP'/SOP'' Soft Reset or Cable Reset of a Cable 
Plug or VPD State Diagram
Figure 8.206, "DFP/VCONN Source Soft Reset or Cable Reset of a Cable Plug or VPD State Diagram" below shows the 
state diagram for the Policy Engine in a VCONN Source when performing a Soft Reset or Cable Reset of a Cable Plug or 
VPD on SOP’/SOP’’. The following sections describe operation in each of the states.

8.3.3.25.2.3.1
  PE_DFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset State
The PE_DFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset state Shall be entered from any state when a Protocol Error is detected on 
SOP’/SOP’’ by the Protocol Layer (see Section 6.8.1, "Soft Reset and Protocol Error") or when a Message has not been 
sent after retries on SOP’/SOP’’ while communicating with a Cable Plug/VPD and when there was previous 
communication with the Cable Plug that did not result in a Transmission Error or whenever the Device Policy 
Manager directs a Soft Reset on SOP’/SOP’’.
On entry to the PE_DFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset state the DFP Policy Engine Shall request the SOP’/SOP’’ 
Protocol Layer to perform a Soft Reset, then Shall send a Soft_Reset Message on SOP’/SOP’’ to the Cable Plug/VPD, 
and initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready state, depending on the DFP 
VCONN Source's Power Role, when:

There is no Explicit Contract in place and

An Accept Message has been received on SOP’/SOP’’.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state or PE_SRC_Discovery state, 
depending on the DFP's VCONN Source's Power Role, when:

There is an Explicit Contract in place and

An Accept Message has been received on SOP’/SOP’’.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Cable_Reset state when:

A SenderResponseTimer timeout occurs

Or the Protocol Layer indicates that a transmission error has occurred

Or when a Protocol Error is detected on SOP’/SOP’’ by the Protocol Layer.

1)
Excludes the Soft_Reset Message itself.
2)
Sink only communicates with the Cable Plug when in an Explicit Contract. If the Discover Identity Command is being sent at startup, then the Policy Engine will
subsequently transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state as normal. Otherwise, the Policy Engine will transition to the PE_SRC_Discovery state.
