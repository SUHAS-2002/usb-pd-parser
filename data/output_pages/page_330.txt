Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Test conditions require a change in both positive and negative load steps from 1Hz to 5000Hz, up to the Advertised 
Load Step Magnitude of the full load output including from both 10 mA and 10% initial load. The Source Shall 
ensure that PD Communications meet the transmit and receive masks as specified in Section 5.8.2, "Transmit and 
Receive Masks" under all load conditions.
7.1.12.1.2
  Load Step Magnitude
The default load step magnitude rate Shall be 25% of IoC. The Source May report higher capability tolerating a load 
step of 90% of IoC.
7.1.12.2
  Holdup Time Field
The Holdup Time field Shall return a numeric value of the number of milliseconds the output voltage stays in 
regulation upon a short interruption of the AC Supply. 
An AC Supplied Source Shall report its holdup time in this field. The holdup time is measured with the load at rated 
maximum, with the AC Supply at 115VAC rms and 60Hz (or at 230VAC rms and 50Hz for a Source that does not 
support 115VAC AC Supply). The reported time describes the minimum length of time from the last completed AC 
Supply input cycle (zero-degree phase angle) until when the output voltage decays below vSrcValid (min). Sources 
are recommended to support a minimum of 3ms and are preferred to support over 10 milliseconds holdup time 
(equivalent to a half cycle drop from the AC Supply). See Figure 7.15, "Holdup Time Measurement".

7.1.12.3
  Compliance Field
An SPR Source claiming LPS, PS1 or PS2 compliance (see [IEC 62368-1]) Shall report its Capabilities in the 
Compliance field. Since the SPR Source May have several potential output voltage and current settings, every SPR 
Source supply (each indicated by a PDO) Shall be compliant to LPS requirements. 
Note:
According to the requirements of [IEC 60950-1] and/or [IEC 62368-3], a device tested and certified with 
an LPS Source (SPR Source or EPR Source operating in SPR Mode) is prohibited from using a non-LPS 
Source (EPR Source operating in EPR Mode). Alternatively, [IEC 62368-1], classifies power sources 
according to their maximum, constrained power output (15watts or 100watts).
7.1.12.4
  Peak Current
The Source reports its ability to source peak current delivery in excess of the Negotiated amount in the Peak 
Current field. The duration of peak current Shall be followed by a current consumption below the Operating 
Current (IoC) in order to maintain average power delivery below the IoC current.
