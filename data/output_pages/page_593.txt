PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer.

Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine requests that the Data Role is changed to DFP 
(Host), with Port Data Role set to DFP and continues 
supplying power as a Source (Rp asserted).
The Policy Engine requests that Data Role is changed 
from DFP (Host) to UFP (Device).
The Power Delivery Data Role is now a UFP (Device), 
with Port Data Role set to UFP, still operating as a Sink 
(Rd asserted).
The Data Role Swap is complete; the Data Roles have been reversed while maintaining the direction of power flow.
