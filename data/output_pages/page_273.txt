  Collision Avoidance
To avoid Message collisions due to asynchronous Messaging sent from the Sink, the Source sets Rp to SinkTxOK to 
indicate to the Sink that it is OK to initiate an AMS. When the Source wishes to initiate an AMS, it sets Rp to SinkTxNG. 
When the Sink detects that Rp is set to SinkTxOK it May initiate an AMS. When the Sink detects that Rp is set to 
SinkTxNG it Shall Not initiate an AMS and Shall only send Messages that are part of an AMS the Source has initiated.
Note:
This restriction applies to SOP* AMS's i.e., for both Port to Port and Port to Cable Plug communications.
If a transition into the PE_SRC_Ready state will result in an immediate transition out of the PE_SRC_Ready state 
within tSrcHoldsBus e.g. it is due to a Protocol Error that has not resulted in a Soft Reset, then the notifications of 
the end of AMS and first Message in an AMS May Not be sent to avoid changing the Rp value unnecessarily.
Note:
A Sink can still send Hard Reset Signaling at any time.
