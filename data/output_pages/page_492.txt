The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
17
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. The Protocol Layer verifies and 
increments the MessageIDCounter and stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
18
The Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that an 
EPR_KeepAlive_Ack Message was successfully sent.
The Policy Engine starts the 
SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer.
