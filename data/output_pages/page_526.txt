17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent.
The Policy Engine starts the VCONNDischargeTimer.
19
When the DPM indicates that VCONN has been turned off 
the Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a PS_RDY Message to request a Soft Reset. 
20
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
21
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the PS_RDY 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
22
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the PS_RDY 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
23
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
The Policy Engine stops the VCONNDischargeTimer 
and requests the DPM perform a Data Reset.
The DPM proceeds to turn on VCONN and then reset the 
data connection.
24
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
26
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
27
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent.
28
The DPM indicates that the Data Reset process is 
complete.
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a Data_Reset_Complete Message. 
29
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
30
PHY Layer receives the Data_Reset_Complete 
Message and compares the CRC it calculated with the 
one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
31
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message to the Protocol Layer.
