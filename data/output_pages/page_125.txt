Figure 6.7 Example Security_Request sequence Chunked (Chunked bit = 1)
Figure 6.8, "Example Security_Request Message of Data Size 7 (Chunked bit set to 1)" shows the Security_Request 
Message shown in Figure 6.7, "Example Security_Request sequence Chunked (Chunked bit = 1)" in more detail 
including the byte ordering on the bus and padding. Three bytes of padding have been added to the Message so that 
the total number of bytes is a multiple of 32-bits, corresponding to 3 Data Objects. The Number of Data Objects 
field is set to 3 to indicate the length of this Chunk. The Chunk Number is set to zero and the Data Size field is set 
to 7 to indicate the length of the whole Extended Message.
