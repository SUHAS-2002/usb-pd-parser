The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Construct_Message state when:

A Message request is received from the Policy Engine which is not a Soft_Reset Message.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Layer_Reset_for_Transmit state when:

A Message request is received from the Policy Engine which is a Soft_Reset Message.
6.12.2.2.1.3
  PRL_Tx_Layer_Reset_for_Transmit State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Layer_Reset_for_Transmit state the Protocol Layer Shall reset the MessageIDCounter. 
The Protocol Layer Shall transition Protocol Layer Message reception to the PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state 
(see Section 6.12.2.3.1, "PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state") in order to reset the stored MessageID.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Construct_Message state when:

The layer reset actions in this state have been completed.
6.12.2.2.1.4
  PRL_Tx_Construct_Message State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Construct_Message state the Protocol Layer Shall construct the Message requested by the 
Policy Engine, or resend a previously constructed Message, and then pass this Message to the PHY Layer.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_PHY_Response state when:

The Message has been sent to the PHY Layer.
6.12.2.2.1.5
  PRL_Tx_Wait_for_PHY_Response State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_PHY_Response state, once the Message has been sent, the Protocol Layer Shall 
initialize and run the CRCReceiveTimer (see Section 6.6.1, "CRCReceiveTimer").
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Match_MessageID state when:

A GoodCRC Message response is received from the PHY Layer.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Check_RetryCounter state when:

The CRCReceiveTimer times out.

Or the PHY Layer indicates that a Message has been Discarded due to the channel being busy but the 
channel is now Idle (see Section 5.7, "Collision Avoidance").
6.12.2.2.1.6
  PRL_Tx_Match_MessageID State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Match_MessageID state the Protocol Layer Shall compare the MessageIDCounter and the 
MessageID of the received GoodCRC Message.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Message_Sent state when:

The MessageIDCounter and the MessageID of the received GoodCRC Message match.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Check_RetryCounter state when:

The MessageIDCounter and the MessageID of the received GoodCRC Message do not match.
6.12.2.2.1.7
  PRL_Tx_Message_Sent State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Message_Sent state the Protocol Layer Shall increment the MessageIDCounter and inform 
the Policy Engine that the Message has been sent.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state when:

The Policy Engine has been informed that the Message has been sent.
