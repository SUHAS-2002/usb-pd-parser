PDP 80W implementation includes:

9V @ 3A, 


SPR AVS with 9V - 15V @ 3A & 15V - 20V @ 4A, 

15V Prog @ 3A, and 

20V Prog @ 4A.
The first example illustrates a basic example of a supply that can only support 5V and 9V.
The second and third examples illustrates as the PDP Rating goes higher there are more possible combinations that 
meet the Power Rules. These examples also add SPR AVS. Although there are multiple ways to meet the Power Rules, 
while operating in SPR Mode no more than a combination of seven SPR (A)PDOs and APDOs can be offered.
The fourth and fifth example show that the 15V Prog @ 3A fully covers the 9V Prog @3A range so it is not necessary 
to Advertise both. These examples also illustrate SPR AVS being extended up to 20V with separate current limits for 
the 9V - 15V and 15V - 20V ranges - a single SPR AVS APDO covers advertising both ranges.
