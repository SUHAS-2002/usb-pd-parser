Table 8.150, "Steps for Cable Plug USB4 Mode Entry (Reject)" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens 
at each labeled step in Figure 8.123, "Cable Plug Entering USB4 Mode (Reject)" above.

1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate an Enter_USB Message to request entry to 
[USB4] mode. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Enter_USB 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Enter_USB Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify 
the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Enter_USB Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Enter_USB 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC 
to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Enter_USB Message was successfully sent. Policy 
Engine starts SenderResponseTimer. 
10
Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form an Reject 
Message.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
13
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
14
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Reject 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
15
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
