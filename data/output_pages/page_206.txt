  EPR_Mode Message
The EPR_Mode Message is used to enter, acknowledge, and exit the EPR Mode. The Action field is used to describe 
the action that is to be taken by the recipient of the EPR_Mode Message. The Data field provides additional 
information for the Message recipient in the EPR Mode Data Object (ERMDO).
The EPR_Mode Message Shall be as shown in Figure 6.33, "EPR Mode DO Message" and Table 6.50, "EPR Mode Data 
Object (EPRMDO)".

  Process to enter EPR Mode
An EPR Source Shall enter EPR Mode upon request by an EPR Sink connected with an EPR Cable when able to offer 
the Source Capabilities as defined in the Power Rules (See Table 10.12, "EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port 
Maximum PDP and using an EPR Capable Cable" and Table 10.13, "EPR Source Capabilities when Port Present PDP is 
less than Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR-capable cable").
For Port Partners to successfully enter EPR Mode, the following conditions must be met:

The Sink Shall request entry into the EPR Mode.
