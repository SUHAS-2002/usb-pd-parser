  Sink EPR Mode Exit State Diagram
Figure 8.214, "Sink EPR Mode Exit State Diagram" shows the state diagram for an EPR Sink initiating the EPR Mode 
exit process.

8.3.3.26.4.1
  PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state from the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

The DPM requests exit from EPR Mode.
On Entry to the PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state the Policy Engine Shall send an EPR_Mode (Exit) Message.
On Exit from the PE_SNK_Send_EPR_Mode_Exit state the Policy Engine Shall exit EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state when:

The EPR_Mode (Exit) Message has been sent.
8.3.3.26.4.2
  PE_SNK_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_SNK_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received state from the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

An EPR_Mode (Exit) Message is received.
On Entry to the PE_SNK_EPR_Mode_Exit_Received state the Policy Engine Shall exit EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state when:

In an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO and

EPR Mode has been exited.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state when:

Not in an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO.
