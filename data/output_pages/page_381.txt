  Changing Voltage or Current within the same AVS APDO
7.3.1.4.1
  Increasing the Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Voltage
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when increasing the 
voltage is shown in Figure 7.36, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Adjustable Power Supply Voltage". The 
sequence that Shall be followed is described in Table 7.15, "Sequence Description for Increasing the Adjustable 
Voltage Supply Voltage". The timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed inTable 7.23, "Source Electrical 
Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.36, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Adjustable Power Supply Voltage", the Sink has pre-
viously sent a Request Message to the Source.
