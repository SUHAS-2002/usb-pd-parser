Section 7.1.14, "Non-application of VBUS Slew Rate Limits" lists transitions that are exempt from the vSrcSlewPos 
limit.
7.1.4.1.2
  Fixed Supply Negative Voltage Transitions
Negative voltage transitions are defined as shown in Figure 7.3, "Transition Envelope for Negative Voltage 
Transitions" and are specified in a similar manner to positive voltage transitions. Figure 7.3, "Transition Envelope 
for Negative Voltage Transitions" does not apply to vSafe0V transitions. The slew rate of the negative transition 
Shall Not exceed vSrcSlewNeg. The negative voltage transition Shall remain below vSrcValid max of the previous 
Explicit Contract and above vSrcValid min of the new Explicit Contract, as shown in FFigure 7.3, "Transition 
Envelope for Negative Voltage Transitions". The transitioning Source output voltage Shall settle to vSrcNew within 
tSrcSettle. The starting time, t0, in Figure 7.3, "Transition Envelope for Negative Voltage Transitions" starts 
tSrcTransition after the last bit of the EOP of the GoodCRC Message has been received by the Source.
Figure 7.3 Transition Envelope for Negative Voltage Transitions
If the newly Negotiated voltage is vSafe5V, then the vSrcValid limits Shall determine the transition window and 
the transitioning Source Shall settle within the vSafe5V limits by tSrcSettle.
Section 7.1.14, "Non-application of VBUS Slew Rate Limits" lists transitions that are exempt from the vSrcSlewNeg 
limit.

  SPR Programmable Power Supply (PPS)
7.1.4.2.1
  SPR Programmable Power Supply Voltage Transitions
The Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Shall transition VBUS over the defined voltage range in a controlled 
manner. The Output Voltage value in the Programmable RDO defines the nominal value of the PPS output voltage 
after completing a voltage change and Shall settle within the limits defined by vPpsNew by tPpsSrcTransSmall for 
steps smaller than or equal to vPpsSmallStep, or else, within the limits defined by vPpsNew by 
tPpsSrcTransLarge, but only in case the Programmable Power Supply is not in CL mode. Any overshoot beyond 
vPpsNew Shall Not exceed vPpsValid at any time. Any undershoot beyond vPpsNew Shall Not exceed vPpsValid 
for currents not resulting in CL mode. The PPS output voltage May change in a step-wise or linear manner and the 
slew rate of either type of change Shall Not exceed vPpsSlewPos for voltage increases or vPpsSlewNeg for voltage 
decreases. The nominal requested voltage of all linear voltage changes Shall equate to an integer number of LSB 
changes. An LSB change of the PPS output voltage is defined as vPpsStep. A PPS Shall be able to supply the 
Negotiated current level as it changes its output voltage to the requested level. All PPS voltage increases Shall
