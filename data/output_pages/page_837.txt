
A Request from the offered Source Capabilities with an indication that another power level would be 
preferred (Capability Mismatch bit set).
When in SPR Mode a Request Message Shall be sent.
When in EPR Mode an EPR_Request Message Shall be sent.
The Policy Engine Shall initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Transition_Sink state when:

An Accept Message is received from the Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Wait_for_Capabilities state when:

There is no Explicit Contract in place and

A Reject Message is received from the Source or

A Wait Message is received from the Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

There is an Explicit Contract in place and

A Reject Message is received from the Source or

A Wait Message is received from the Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state when:

A SenderResponseTimer timeout occurs.
8.3.3.3.6
  PE_SNK_Transition_Sink State
On entry to the PE_SNK_Transition_Sink state the Policy Engine Shall initialize and run the PSTransitionTimer 
(timeout will lead to a Hard Reset see Section 8.3.3.3.8, "PE_SNK_Hard_Reset State" and Shall then request the Device 
Policy Manager to transition the Sink's power supply to the new power level.
Note:
If there is no power level change the Device Policy Manager Should Not affect any change to the power 
supply.
On exit from the PE_SNK_Transition_Sink state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager to 
transition the Sink's power supply to the new power level.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

A PS_RDY Message is received from the Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state when:

A Protocol Error occurs.
8.3.3.3.7
  PE_SNK_Ready State
In the PE_SNK_Ready state the PD Sink Shall be operating at a stable power level with no ongoing Negotiation. It 
Shall respond to requests from the Source, events from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_SNK_Ready state as the result of a wait the Policy Engine Should do the following:

Initialize and run the SinkRequestTimer.
On entry to the PE_SNK_Ready state if this is a VCONN Source which needs to establish communication with a Cable 
Plug, then the Policy Engine Shall do the following: 

Initialize and run the DiscoverIdentityTimer (no GoodCRC Message response yet received to Discover 
Identity Message).
