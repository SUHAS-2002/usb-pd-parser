Note:
That in either case the Attached device is assumed to be unresponsive. The Policy Engine Should operate 
as if the device is Detached until such time as a Detach/Re-attach is detected.
The Policy Engine Shall go to the ErrorRecovery state when:

The Port Partners have previously been PD Connected (the Source Port remains Attached to a Port it has 
had a PD Connection with during this Attachment)

And the NoResponseTimer times out.

And the HardResetCounter > nHardResetCount.
8.3.3.2.4
  PE_SRC_Negotiate_Capability State
On entry to the PE_SRC_Negotiate_Capability state the Policy Engine Shall ask the Device Policy Manager to 
evaluate the Request from the Attached Sink. The response from the Device Policy Manager Shall be one of the 
following:

The Request can be met.

The Request cannot be met

The Request could be met later from the Power Reserve.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Transition_Supply state when:

The Request can be met.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Capability_Response state when:

The Request cannot be met.

Or the Request can be met later from the Power Reserve.
8.3.3.2.5
  PE_SRC_Transition_Supply State
The Policy Engine Shall be in the PE_SRC_Transition_Supply state while the power supply is transitioning from one 
power to another.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Transition_Supply state, the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send an 
Accept Message and inform the Device Policy Manager that it Shall transition the power supply to the Requested 
power level.
Note:
If the power supply is currently operating at the requested power no change will be necessary.
On exit from the PE_SRC_Transition_Supply state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send a 
PS_RDY Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Ready state when:

The Device Policy Manager informs the Policy Engine that the power supply is ready.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

A Protocol Error occurs.
8.3.3.2.6
  PE_SRC_Ready State
In the PE_SRC_Ready state the PD Source Shall be operating at a stable power with no ongoing Negotiation. It Shall 
respond to requests from the Sink, events from the Device Policy Manager.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Ready state the Source Shall notify the Protocol Layer of the end of the Atomic Message 
Sequence (AMS). If the transition into PE_SRC_Ready is the result of Protocol Error that has not caused a Soft Reset 
(see Section 8.3.3.4.1, "SOP Source Port Soft Reset and Protocol Error State Diagram") then the notification to the 
Protocol Layer of the end of the AMS Shall Not be sent since there is a Message to be processed.
