Timers are included in many of the states. Timers are initialized (set to their starting condition) and run (timer is 
counting) in the particular state it is referenced. As soon as the state is exited then the timer is no longer active. 
Where the timers continue to run outside of the state (such as the NoResponseTimer), this is called out in the text. 
Timeouts of the timers are listed as conditions on state transitions.
The SenderResponseTimer is a special case, as it May be stopped and started from outside the states in which it 
is used. To allow this to be done without over-complicating the state diagrams, the SenderResponseTimer is 
described with its own state diagram (Figure 8.131, "SenderResponseTimer Policy Engine State Diagram"). The 
control of this Timer is shared between the Policy Engine and the Chunking Layer.
