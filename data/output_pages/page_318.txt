7.1.4.2.3
  SPR PPS Constant Power Mode
In Constant Power mode (when the PPS Power Limited bit is set) the Source May supply power that exceeds the 
Source's PDP Rating. Sinks May limit their Operating Current request in the RDO and Shall meet the requirements 
of Section 7.2.9, "Robust Sink Operation".
The tolerances along the Constant Power Curve Shall Not extend into the Guaranteed Capability Area of Figure 7.7, 
"SPR PPS Constant Power".

Point a represents entry into the transition region between Constant Voltage mode and Current Limit mode.
Point b represents exit from the transition region between Constant Voltage mode and Current Limit mode.
Point c represents the exit from the iPpsCLNew region as the voltage drops below the PPS APDO Min Voltage.
The Source May disconnect at any point inside the tolerance range of the minimum voltage defined in the PPS APDO.
