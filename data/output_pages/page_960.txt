  BIST Carrier Mode State Diagram
Figure 8.215, "BIST Carrier Mode State Diagram" shows the state diagram required by a UUT, which can be either a 
Source, Sink or Cable Plug, when operating in BIST Carrier Mode. Transitions Shall be from either the 
PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or PE_CBL_Ready states.

  PE_BIST_Carrier_Mode State
The Source, Sink or Cable Plug Shall enter the PE_BIST_Carrier_Mode state from either the PE_SRC_Ready, 
PE_SNK_Ready or PE_CBL_Ready state when:

A BIST Message is received with a BIST Carrier Mode BIST Data Object and 

VBUS is at vSafe5V.
On entry to the PE_BIST_Carrier_Mode state the Policy Engine Shall tell the Protocol Layer to go to BIST Carrier 
Mode (see Section 6.4.3.1, "BIST Carrier Mode") and Shall initialize and run the BISTContModeTimer.
