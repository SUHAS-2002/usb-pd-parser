Table 8.3  Basic Message Flow with CRC failure
Step
Message Sender
Message Receiver
1
Policy Engine directs Protocol Layer to send a Message. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives no Message or a Message with an 
incorrect CRC. Nothing is passed to Protocol Layer.
4
Since no response is received, the CRCReceiveTimer 
will expire and trigger the first retry by the Protocol 
Layer. The RetryCounter is incremented. Protocol Layer 
passes the Message to the PHY Layer.
5
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Message and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
6
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the Message 
to the Protocol Layer.
7
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
Protocol Layer forwards the received Message 
information to the Policy Engine that consumes it.
8
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to the PHY Layer.
9
PHY Layer receives the Message and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
10
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
11
Protocol Layer verifies the MessageID, stops 
CRCReceiveTimer and resets the RetryCounter. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Message was successfully sent.
