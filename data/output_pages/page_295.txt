  PRL_HR_Reset_Layer state
The PRL_HR_Reset_Layer State defines the mode of operation of both the Protocol Layer transmission and 
reception state machines during a Hard Reset or Cable Reset. During Hard Reset no USB Power Delivery Protocol 
Messages are sent or received; only Hard Reset Signaling is present after which the communication channel is 
assumed to have been disabled by the PHY Layer until completion of the Hard Reset. During Cable Reset no USB 
Power Delivery Protocol Messages are sent to or received by the Cable Plug but other USB Power Delivery 
communication May continue.
The Protocol Layer Shall enter the PRL_HR_Reset_Layer state from any other state when:

A Hard Reset Request is received from the Policy Engine or

Hard Reset Signaling is received from the PHY Layer or 
Hard Reset request received from Policy Engine2 |

HardResetCompleteTimer timeout1
1)
If the HardResetCompleteTimer timeout occurs this means that the PHY is still waiting to send the Hard Reset due to a non-idle channel.  This condition will be cleared once the PE Hard Reset is completed.
2)
Cable Plugs do not generate Hard Reset signaling but are required to monitor for Hard Reset signaling between the Port Partners and respond by resetting.
3)
Cable Reset signaling is only recognized by a Cable Plug.
4)
Cable Reset signaling cannot be generated by Cable Plugs.
