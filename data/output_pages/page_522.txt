17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent.
The Policy Engine requests the DPM to turn off VCONN.
19
When the DPM indicates VCONN has been turned off the 
Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form an 
PS_RDY Message.
20
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
21
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Accept 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
22
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
23
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that consumes 
it.
The Policy Engine stops the VCONNDischargeTimer and 
tells the DPM to perform a Data Reset.
The DPM proceeds to turn on VCONN and then reset the 
data connection.
24
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and passes 
it PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
26
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
27
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent.
28
The DPM indicates that the Data Reset process is 
complete.
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to generate 
a Data_Reset_Complete Message. 
29
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
30
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Data_Reset_Complete Message 
and compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
31
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message to the Protocol Layer.
