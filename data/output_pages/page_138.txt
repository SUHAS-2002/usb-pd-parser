  Data Message
A Data Message Shall consist of a Message Header and be followed by one or more Data Objects. Data Messages are 
easily identifiable because the Number of Data Objects field in the Message Header is a non-zero value.
There are many types of Data Objects used to compose Data Messages. Some examples are:

Power Data Object (PDO) used to expose a Source Port's power Capabilities or a Sink's power 
requirements.

Request Data Object (RDO) used by a Sink Port to Negotiate an Explicit Contract.

Vendor Data Object (VDO) used to convey vendor specific information.

BIST Data Object (BDO) used for PHY Layer compliance testing.

Battery Status Data Object (BSDO) used to convey Battery status information.

Alert Data Object (ADO) used to indicate events occurring on the Source or Sink.
The type of Data Object being used in a Data Message is defined by the Message Header's Message Type field and 
is summarized in Table 6.6, "Data Message Types". The Sent by column indicates entities which May send the given 
Message (Source, Sink or Cable Plug); entities not listed Shall Not issue the corresponding Message. The "Valid Start 
of Packet" column indicates the Messages which Shall only be issued in SOP Packets and the Messages which May 
be issued in SOP* Packets.
