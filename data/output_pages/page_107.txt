  Capacitance when not transmitting
cReceiver is the capacitance that a DFP or UFP Shall present on the CC line when the DFP or UFP's receiver is not 
transmitting on the line. The transmitter May have more capacitance than cReceiver while driving the CC line, but 
Shall meet the waveform mask requirements. Once transmission is complete, the transmitter Shall disengage 
capacitance in excess of cReceiver from the CC wire within tInterFrameGap.
5.8.5.2
  Source Output Impedance
Source output impedance zDriver is determined by the driver resistance and the shunt capacitance of the Source 
and is hence a frequency dependent term. zDriver impacts the noise ingression in the cable. It is specified such that 
the noise at the Receiver is bounded.
zDriver is defined by the following equation:
zDriver=rOutput/(1+s*rOutput*cShunt)

cShunt Shall Not cause a violation of cReceiver when not transmitting.
5.8.5.3
  Bit Rate Drift
Limits on the drift in fBitRate are set to help low-complexity receiver implementations.
fBitRate is the reciprocal of the average bit duration from the previous 32 bits at a given portion of the Packet. The 
change in fBitRate during a Packet Shall be less than pBitRate. The reference bit rate (refBitRate) is the average 
fBitRate over the last 32 bits of the Preamble. fBitRate throughout the Packet, including the EOP, Shall be within 
pBitRate of refBitRate. pBitRate is expressed as a percentage:
pBitRate = | fBitRate - refBitRate | / refBitRate x 100%
The transmitter Shall have the same pBitRate for all Packet types. The BIST Carrier Mode and Bit Stream signals 
are continuous signals without a Payload. When checking pBitRate any set of 1044 bits (20 bit SOP followed by 
1024 PRBS bits) within a continuous signal May be considered as the part of the Packet following the Preamble and 
the 32 preceding bits considered to be the last 32 bits of the Preamble used to compute refBitRate.
