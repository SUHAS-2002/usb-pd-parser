The Device Policy Manager talks to the communication stack, Source/Sink, and the USB-C® Port Control block to 
manage the resources in the Provider or Consumer.
Figure 2.5, "High Level Architecture View" illustrates a Provider and a Consumer. Dual-Role Power Devices can be 
constructed by combining the elements of both Provider and Consumer into a single device. Providers can also 
contain multiple Source Ports each with their own communications stack and USB-C® Port Control.

2.6.1
  Policy
There are two levels of Policy:
1)
System Policy applied system wide by the System Policy Manager across multiple Providers or Consumers.
3)
Local Policy enforced on a Provider or Consumer by the Device Policy Manager for a device.
Policy comprises several logical blocks:

System Policy Manager (system wide).

Device Policy Manager (one per Provider or Consumer).

Policy Engine (one per Source Port or Sink Port).
2.6.1.1
  System Policy Manager
Since the USB Power Delivery protocol is Port to Port, implementation of a System Policy requires communication 
by an additional data communication mechanism i.e., USB. [UCSI]has been created to define an interface for the 
System Policy Manager to communicate with the Device Policy Manager. When present, the System Policy Manager 
monitors and controls System Policy between various Providers and Consumers connected via USB. The System 
Policy Manager resides in the USB Host and communicates via USB with the Device Policy Manager in each 
connected Device. Devices without USB Communication capability or are not data connected, will not be able to 
participate in System Policy.
The System Policy Manager is Optional so USB Power Delivery Providers and Consumers will operate without it 
being present. This includes systems where the USB Host does not provide a System Policy Manager and can also 
include "headless" systems without any USB Host. In those cases where a USB Host is not present, USB Power 
Delivery is useful for charging purposes, or the powering of devices since useful USB functionality is not possible. 
Where there is a USB Host, but no System Policy Manager, Providers and Consumers can Negotiate power between
