  Fast Role Swap
This is an example of a successful Fast Role Swap operation initiated by a Port that is initially a Source and therefore 
has Rp pulled up on its CC wire and which has lost power and needs to get vSafe5V quickly. It does not include any 
subsequent Power Negotiation which is required in order to establish an Explicit Contract (see Section 8.3.2.2, 
"Power Negotiation"). 
There are several distinct phases to the Fast Role Swap Negotiation:

The Initial Source stops driving its power output which starts transitioning to vSafe0V and send the 
Fast Role Swap Request on the CC wire; these could occur in either order or simultaneously.

The Initial Sink stops sinking power. At this point the New Source still has Rd asserted and the New Sink 
still has Rp asserted.

An FR_Swap Message is sent by the New Source within tFRSwapInit of detecting the Fast Swap signal.

An Accept Message is sent by the New Sink in response to the FR_Swap Message.

The New Sink asserts Rd and sends a PS_RDY Message indicating that the voltage on VBUS is at or below 
vSafe5V.

The New Source asserts Rp and sends a PS_RDY Message indicating that it is acting as a Source and is sup-
plying vSafe5V.
Note:
The New Source can start applying VBUS when VBUS is at or below vSafe5V (max) but will start driving 
VBUS to vSafe5V no later than tSrcFRSwap after detecting both the Fast Role Swap Request and that VBUS 
has dropped below vSafe5V (min).
Figure 8.39, "Successful Fast Role Swap Sequence" shows the Messages as they flow across the bus and within the 
devices to accomplish the Fast Role Swap.
