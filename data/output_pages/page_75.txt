  Charging Models
This section provides a charging model overview for each of the primary power delivery methods: Fixed Supply, 
Programmable Power Supply and Adjustable Voltage Supply.
2.8.1
  Fixed Supply Charging Models
USB Power Delivery supports Fixed Supply charging using a set of defined standard voltages with current available 
up to the limit of the Source's and cable's Advertised Capabilities. As summarized in Table 2.1, "Fixed Supply Power 
Ranges", the standard voltages are available in either the Standard Power Range (SPR) and/or the Extended Power 
Range (EPR).
2.8.2
  Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Charging Models
USB Power Delivery includes support for Programmable Power Supply (PPS) charging using a set of defined 
standard voltage ranges. With current up to the limit of the Source's and cable's Advertised Capabilities. 
Additionally, when operating in SPR Mode the current is also limited by the Operating Current field value in the 
Request Message. 
Note:
PPS operation is not available in EPR Mode.
The standard voltage ranges available in the Standard Power Range (SPR) for PPS are summarized in Table 2.2, 
"PPS Voltage Power Ranges".
