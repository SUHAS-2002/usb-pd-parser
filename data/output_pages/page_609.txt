  VCONN Source Swap, initiated by non-VCONN Source
8.3.2.10.2.1
  VCONN Source Swap, initiated by non-VCONN Source (Accept)
Figure 8.55, "VCONN Source Swap, initiated by non-VCONN Source" shows an example where the Port which is not 
initially supplying VCONN and requests a VCONN Swap. During the process the Port Partners, keep their Power Role 
as Source or Sink, maintain their operation as either a Source or a Sink (power remains constant) but exchange the 
VCONN Source.
