Figure 6.8 Example Security_Request Message of Data Size 7 (Chunked bit set to 1)
Figure 6.9, "Example Chunk 0 of Security_Response Message of Data Size 30 (Chunked bit set to 1)" shows Chunk 
Number zero of the Security_Response Message shown in Figure 6.7, "Example Security_Request sequence Chunked 
(Chunked bit = 1)" in more detail including the byte ordering on the bus and padding. No padding is need for this 
Chunk since the full 26-byte Payload plus 2-byte Extended Message Header is a multiple of 32-bits, corresponding 
to 7 Data Objects. The Number of Data Objects field is set to 7 to indicate the length of this Chunk and the Data 
Size field is set to 30 to indicate the length of the whole Extended Message.
Figure 6.9 Example Chunk 0 of Security_Response Message of Data Size 30 (Chunked bit set to 1)
Figure 6.7, "Example Security_Request sequence Chunked (Chunked bit = 1)" shows an example of the Message 
format, byte ordering and padding for the Security_Response Message Chunk request for Chunk Number one 
shown in Figure 6.7, "Example Security_Request sequence Chunked (Chunked bit = 1)". In the Chunk request the 
Number of Data Objects field in the Message is set to 1 to indicate that the Payload is 32 bits equivalent to 1 data 
object (see Figure 6.10, "Example byte transmission for a Security_Response Message Chunk request (Chunked bit is 
set to 1)"). Since the Chunked bit is set to 1 the Chunk request/Chunk response mechanism is used. The Message is 
a Chunk request so the Request Chunk bit is set to one, and in this case Chunk one is being requested so Chunk 
Number is set to one. Data Size is set to zero indicating the length of the Data Block being transferred. Two bytes 
of padding are added to ensure that the Payload is a multiple of 32 bits.
