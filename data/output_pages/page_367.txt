  Changing Voltage or Current within the same PPS APDO
7.3.1.3.1
  Increasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Voltage
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when increasing the 
voltage is shown in Figure 7.31, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Programmable Power Supply Voltage". The 
sequence that Shall be followed is described in Table 7.10, "Sequence Description for Increasing the Programmable 
Power Supply Voltage". The timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical 
Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.31, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Programmable Power Supply Voltage", the Sink has 
previously sent a Request Message to the Source.
