6.12.2.2.1.8
  PRL_Tx_Check_RetryCounter State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Check_RetryCounter state the Protocol Layer in a DFP or UFP Shall increment the value of 
the RetryCounter and then check it in order to determine whether it is necessary to retry sending the Message.
Note:
Cable Plugs do not retry Messages and so do not use the RetryCounter.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Construct_Message state in order to retry Message sending 
when:

RetryCounter ≤ nRetryCount and

This is not a Cable Plug and

This is an Extended Message with Data Size ≤ MaxExtendedMsgLegacyLen or 

This is an Extended Message that has been Chunked.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Transmission_Error state when:

RetryCounter > nRetryCount or

This is a Cable Plug, which does not retry.

This is an Extended Message with Data Size > MaxExtendedMsgLegacyLen that has not been Chunked.
6.12.2.2.1.9
  PRL_Tx_Transmission_Error State
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Transmission_Error state the Protocol Layer Shall increment the MessageIDCounter and 
inform the Policy Engine of the transmission error.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state when:

The Policy Engine has been informed of the transmission error.
6.12.2.2.1.10
  PRL_Tx_Discard_Message State
Protocol Layer Message transmission Shall enter the PRL_Tx_Discard_Message state whenever:

Protocol Layer Message reception receives an incoming Message or

The Fast Role Swap Request is being transmitted (see Section 5.8.5.6, "Fast Role Swap Transmission")

The Fast Role Swap Request is detected (see Section 5.8.6.3, "Fast Role Swap Detection").
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Discard_Message state, if there is a Message queued awaiting transmission, the Protocol 
Layer Shall Discard the Message according to the rules in Section 6.11, "Message Discarding" and increment the 
MessageIDCounter.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_PHY_Layer_Reset state when:

Discarding is complete i.e., the Message queue is empty.
