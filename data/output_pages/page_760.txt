  Initiator to Responder Discover SVIDs (NAK)
Figure 8.106, "Initiator to Responder Discover SVIDs (NAK)" shows an example sequence between an Initiator and 
Responder, where both Port Partners are in an Explicit Contract and the Initiator attempts to discover SVID 
information from the Responder but receives a NAK.
