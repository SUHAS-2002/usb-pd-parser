  Message Applicability
The following tables outline the Messages supported by a given Port, depending on its capability. 
When a Message is supported the feature and the AMS implied by the Message Shall also be supported. The 
abbreviations in Table 6.76, "Message Applicability Abbreviations" are used in this section to denote the level of 
support required.
For the case of Conditional Normative a note has been added to indicate the condition. "CN/" notation is used to 
indicate the level of support when the condition is not present.
"R/" and "O/" notation is used to indicate the response when the Recommended or Optional Message is not 
supported.
Note:
Where NS/R/NK is indicated for Received Messages this Shall apply to the PE_CBL_Ready, 
PE_SNK_Ready or PE_SRC_Ready states only since unexpected Messages received during an AMS are Pro-
tocol Errors (see Section 6.8.1, "Soft Reset and Protocol Error").
This section covers Control Message and Data Message support for Sources, Sink and Cable Plugs. It also covers VDM 
Command support for DFPs, UFPs and Cable Plugs.
