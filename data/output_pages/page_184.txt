6.4.4.3.1.9
  VCONN Powered USB Device VDO
The VCONN Powered USB Device (VPD) VDO defined in this section Shall be sent when the Product Type is given as 
VCONN Powered USB Device. Table 6.44, "VPD VDO" defines the VPD VDO which Shall be sent.
6.4.4.3.1.9.1
  HW Version Field
The HW Version field (B31…28) contains a HW version assigned by the VID owner.
6.4.4.3.1.9.2
  FW Version Field
The Firmware Version field (B27…24) contains a FW version assigned by the VID owner.
6.4.4.3.1.9.3
  VDO Version Field
The VDO Version field (B23…20) contains a VDO Version for this VDM Version number. This field indicates the 
expected content for this VDO.
6.4.4.3.1.9.4
  Maximum VBUS Voltage Field
The Maximum VBUS Voltage field (B16…15) Shall contain the maximum voltage that a Sink Shall Negotiate 
through the VPD Charge Through Port as part of an Explicit Contract.
Note:
The maximum voltage that will be applied to the cable is vSrcNew max + vSrcValid max. For example, 
when the Maximum VBUS Voltage field is 20V, a Fixed Supply of 20V can be Negotiated as part of an
