  Transmit and Receive Masks
5.8.2.1
  Transmit Masks
The transmitted signal Shall Not violate the masks defined in Figure 5.15, "BMC Tx 'ONE' Mask", Figure 5.16, "BMC 
Tx 'ZERO' Mask", Table 5.14, "BMC Tx Mask Definition, X Values" and Table 5.15, "BMC Tx Mask Definition, Y Values" 
at the output of a load equivalent to the cable model and receiver load model described in Section 5.8.3, 
"Transmitter Load Model". The masks apply to the full range of Rp/Rd values as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
Note:
The measurement of the transmitter does not need to accommodate a change in signal offset due to the 
ground offset when current is flowing in the cable.
The transmitted signal Shall have a rise time no faster than tRise. The transmitted signal Shall have a fall time no 
faster than tFall. The maximum limits on the rise and fall times are enforced by the Tx inner masks.
