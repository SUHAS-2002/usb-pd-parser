  EPR_KeepAlive Message
The EPR_KeepAlive Message May be sent by a Sink operating in EPR Mode to meet the requirement for periodic 
traffic. The Source operating on EPR Mode responds by returning an EPR_KeepAlive_Ack Message to the Sink. See 
Section 6.4.9, "EPR_Request Message" for additional information.
6.5.14.4
  EPR_KeepAlive_Ack Message
The EPR_KeepAlive_Ack Message Shall be sent by a Source operating in EPR Mode in response to an EPR_KeepAlive 
Message. See Section 6.4.9, "EPR_Request Message" for additional information.
6.5.15
  EPR Capabilities Message
The EPR Capabilities Message is an Extended Capabilities Message made of Power Data Objects (PDO) defined in 
Section 6.4.1, "Capabilities Message". It is used to form EPR_Source_Capabilities Messages and 
EPR_Sink_Capabilities Messages. Sources expose their EPR power Capabilities by sending an 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message. Sinks expose their EPR power requirements by returning an 
EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message when requested. Both are composed of a number of 32-bit Power Data Objects (see 
Table 6.7, "Power Data Object").
An EPR Capabilities Message Shall have a 5V Fixed Supply PDO containing the sending Port's information in the first 
object position followed by up to 10 additional PDOs.
6.5.15.1
  EPR Capabilities Message Construction
The EPR Capabilities Messages (EPR_Source_Capabilities and EPR_Sink_Capabilities) are Extended Messages with 
the first seven positions filled with the same SPR (A)PDOs returned by the SPR Capabilities Messages 
(Source_Capabilities and Sink_Capabilities) followed by the EPR (A)PDOs starting in the eighth position. See 
Figure 6.54, "Mapping SPR Capabilities to EPR Capabilities".
Figure 6.54 Mapping SPR Capabilities to EPR Capabilities
Power Data Objects in the EPR Capabilities Messages Shall be sent in the following order:
1)
The SPR (A)PDOs as reported in the SPR Capabilities Message. The Number of Data Objects field in the 
Message Header of the EPR Capabilities Message is the same as the Number of Data Objects field in the 
Message Header of the SPR Capabilities Message.
2)
If the SPR Capabilities Message contains fewer than 7 PDOs, the unused Data Objects Shall be zero filled.
3)
The EPR (A)PDOs as defined in Section 6.4.1, "Capabilities Message" Shall start at Data Object position 8 
and Shall be sent in the following order:
a)
Fixed Supply PDOs that offer 28V, 36V or 48V, if present, Shall be sent in voltage order; lowest to 
highest.
b)
One EPR AVS APDO Shall be sent.
