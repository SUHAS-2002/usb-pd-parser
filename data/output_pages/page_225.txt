  Power state change
The Power State Change field contains two status bytes; the New Power State and New Power State indicator status 
bytes.
6.5.2.1.7.1
  New power state
The New Power State status byte indicates a power state change to one of the specified power states. Any device 
that supports the ACPI standard system power states Shall use the ACPI states. For devices that do not support the 
ACPI power states, the following mapping Should be used:

High power (on) state 
-> S0

Sleep state 
-> S3

Low power (off) state 
-> S5 or G3
6.5.2.1.7.2
  New power state indicator
The New Power State indicator status byte defines the host's desired indicator for the specified power state. This 
indicator allows several possibilities for predefined behaviors that the host can specify to indicate its system 
power state to the user via the downstream device. The New Power State indicator is a "best effort" indicator. If 
the device cannot provide the requested indicator, then it provides the best indicator that it can. If a Breathing 
indicator cannot be provided, then a Blinking indicator Should be provided. If a Blinking indicator cannot be 
provided, then a constant on indicator Should be provided.
New Power State indicators in decreasing precedence:

Breathing

Blinking

Constant on

No indicator
