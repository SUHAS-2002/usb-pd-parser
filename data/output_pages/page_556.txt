  Sink Initiated Power Role Swap (Wait)
This is an example of a Power Role Swap operation, responded to with wait, initiated by a Port which initially, at the 
start of this Message sequence, is acting as a Sink and therefore has Rd pulled down on its CC wire. 
There are several phases to the Power Role Swap:

A PR_Swap Message is sent.

A Wait Message in response to the PR_Swap Message.
Figure 8.38, "Power Role Swap Sequence with wait Initiated by the Sink" shows the Messages as they flow across the 
bus and within the devices.
