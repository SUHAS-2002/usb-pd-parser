1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
The Policy Engine waits tSrcTransition then sends 
the PS_RDY Message to the Sink starting within 
tSrcTransReq of the end of the GoodCRC Message 
following the Accept Message.
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message.
4
Policy Engine receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Note: The decision that no power transition is re-
quired could be made either by the Device Pol-
icy Manager or the power supply depending 
on implementation.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine evaluates the PS_RDY Message.
