Table 7.16  Sequence Description for Decreasing the Adjustable Voltage Supply Voltage
Step
Source Port
Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to decrease its 
output voltage. 
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then and starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
After sending the Accept Message, the AVS starts to 
decrease its output voltage. The AVS new voltage set-
point Shall be reached by tAvsSrcTransLarge for 
steps larger than vAvsSmallStep or else by 
tAvsSrcTransSmall. The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it has reached the new 
level. The power supply status is passed to the Policy 
Engine.
4
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tAvsSrcTransSmall or 
tAvsSrcTransLarge of the end of the GoodCRC 
Message following the Accept Message.
The Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from 
the Source.
5
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer, evaluates the PS_RDY Message 
from the Source and tells the Device Policy Manager 
that the Source is operating at the new voltage set 
point (corresponding to vAvsNew).
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
