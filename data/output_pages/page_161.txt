6.4.3.3
  BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode
A Shared Capacity Group of Ports share a common power source that is not capable of simultaneously powering all 
the ports to their full Source Capabilities (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). The BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode Shall only be 
implemented by ports in a Shared Capacity Group.
The UUT Shared Capacity Group of Ports Shall contain one or more Ports, designated as Master Ports, that 
recognize both the BIST Shared Test Mode Entry BIST Data Object and the BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data 
Object.
6.4.3.3.1
  BIST Shared Test Mode Entry
When any master Port in a Shared Capacity Group receives a BIST Message with a BIST Shared Test Mode Entry 
BIST Data Object, while in the PE_SRC_Ready State, the UUT Shall enter a compliance test mode where the 
maximum Source Capabilities are always offered on every Port, regardless of the availability of shared power i.e., 
all shared power management is disabled. 
Ports in the Shared Capacity Group that are not Master Ports Shall Not enter compliance mode on receiving the 
BIST Shared Test Mode Entry BIST Data Object.
Upon receipt of a BIST Message, with a BIST Shared Test Mode Entry BIST Data Object, the UUT Shall return a 
GoodCRC Message and Shall enter the BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode. 
On entering this mode, the UUT Shall send a new Source_Capabilities Message from each Port in the Shared 
Capacity Group within tBISTSharedTestMode. The Tester will not exceed the shared capacity during this mode.
6.4.3.3.2
  BIST Shared Test Mode Exit
Upon receipt of a BIST Message, with a BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object, the UUT Shall return a 
GoodCRC Message and Shall exit the BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode. If any other Message, aside from a BIST 
Message, with a BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object, is received while in BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode 
this Shall Not cause the UUT to exit the BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode
On exiting the mode, the UUT May send a new Source_Capabilities Message to each Port in the Shared Capacity 
Group or the UUT May perform ErrorRecovery on each Port. 
Ports in the Shared Capacity Group that are not Master Ports Shall Not exit compliance mode on receiving the BIST 
Shared Test Mode Entry BIST Data Object.
Ports in the Shared Capacity Group that are not Master Ports Should Not exit compliance mode on receiving the 
BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object.

The UUT Shall exit BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode when It is powered off.

The UUT Shall remain in BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode for any PD event (except when a BIST Shared 
Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object, is received); specifically the UUT Shall remain in BIST Shared Capacity 
Test Mode when any of the following PD events occurs: 

Hard Reset

Cable Reset

Soft Reset

Data Role Swap

Power Role Swap

Fast Role Swap

VCONN Swap.

The UUT May leave BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode if the Tester makes a request that exceeds the 
Capabilities of the UUT.
