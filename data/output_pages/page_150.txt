Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
The voltage fields Shall be set to the output voltage range that the Sink requires to operate. The Operational Power 
field Shall be set to the operational power that the Sink requires at the given voltage range. The absolute voltage, 
including any voltage variation, Shall Not fall below the Minimum Voltage field value and Shall Not exceed the 
Maximum Voltage field value. 
Note:
Only the Battery Supply PDO uses power instead of current. 
Required operating power is defined as the amount of power a given device needs to be functional. This value could 
be the maximum power the Sink will ever require or could be sufficient to operate the Sink in one of its modes of 
operation.
6.4.1.3.4
  Augmented Power Data Objects
See Section 7.1.3, "Types of Sources" for the electrical requirements of the power supply.
The Maximum and Minimum voltage fields Shall be set to the output voltage range that the Sink requires to 
operate.
6.4.1.3.4.1
  SPR Programmable Power Supply APDO
Table 6.20, "SPR Programmable Power Supply APDO – Sink" below describes a SPR PPS APDO for a Sink operating in 
SPR Mode and consuming 21V or less. The Maximum Current field Shall be set to the maximum current the Sink 
requires over the voltage range. The maximum current is defined as the maximum amount of current the device 
needs to fully support its function (e.g., Sink Directed Charge).
