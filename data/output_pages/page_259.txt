The ChunkSenderRequestTimer Shall be stopped when:

The last bit of the EOP of the GoodCRC Message, corresponding to the Chunk Request Message, is trans-
mitted by the PHY Layer. 

A Message other than a Chunk Request is received from the Protocol Layer Rx.
The receiver of a Chunk Response requiring a Chunk Request Shall respond with a Chunk Request within 
tChunkReceiverRequest in order to ensure that the sender's ChunkSenderRequestTimer does not expire. 
The tChunkReceiverRequest time Shall be measured from the time the last bit of the EOP of the GoodCRC Message, 
corresponding to the Chunk Response Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer until the first bit of the 
response Message Preamble has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.18.3
  ChunkSenderResponseTimer
The ChunkSenderResponseTimer is used during a Chunked Message transmission.
The ChunkSenderResponseTimer Shall be used by the sender's Chunking state machine to ensure that a Chunk 
Request is responded to within a bounded time of tChunkSenderResponse. Failure to receive the expected 
response is detected when the ChunkSenderResponseTimer expires. 
The ChunkSenderResponseTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Chunk Request Message, is received by 
the PHY Layer.
The ChunkSenderResponseTimer Shall be stopped when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Chunk Response Message, is transmitted 
by the PHY Layer.

A Message other than a Chunk is received from the Protocol Layer.
The receiver of a Chunk Request requiring a Chunk Response Shall respond with a Chunk Response within 
tChunkReceiverResponse in order to ensure that the sender's ChunkSenderResponseTimer does not expire. 
The tChunkReceiverResponse time Shall be measured from the time the last bit of the EOP of the GoodCRC 
Message, corresponding to the Chunk Request Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer until the first bit of 
the response Message Preamble has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.

  Programmable Power Supply Timers
6.6.19.1
  SinkPPSPeriodicTimer
The SinkPPSPeriodicTimer Shall be used by the Sink's Policy Engine to ensure that communication between the 
Sink and Source occurs within a bounded time of tPPSRequest when in SPR PPS Mode. In the absence of any other 
traffic, a Request Message requesting an SPR PPS APDO is sent periodically as a keep alive mechanism. 
SinkPPSPeriodicTimer Shall be re-initialized and restarted on transmission, by the PHY Layer, of the last bit of the 
GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to any received Message, that causes the Sink to enter the PE_SNK_Ready 
state.
The Sink Shall stop the SinkPPSPeriodicTimer on transmission, by the PHY Layer, of the last bit of the GoodCRC 
Message EOP, corresponding to any Message, or the last bit of any Signaling is received, by the PHY Layer, from the 
Source and by the Sink that causes the Sink to leave the PE_SNK_Ready state.
6.6.19.2
  SourcePPSCommTimer
The SourcePPSCommTimer Shall be used by the Source's Policy Engine to ensure that communication between 
the Sink and Source occurs within a bounded time of tPPSTimeout when in SPR PPS Mode. In the absence of any 
other traffic, a Request Message requesting an SPR PPS APDO is received periodically as a keep alive mechanism.
