On entry to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall request the generation of Hard Reset Signaling 
by the PHY Layer and increment the HardResetCounter.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Transition_to_default state when:

The Hard Reset is complete.
8.3.3.3.9
  PE_SNK_Transition_to_default State
The Policy Engine Shall transition from any state to PE_SNK_Transition_to_default state when:

Hard Reset Signaling is detected.
When Hard Reset Signaling is received or transmitted then the Policy Engine Shall transition from any state to 
PE_SNK_Transition_to_default. This state can also be entered from the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state.
On entry to the PE_SNK_Transition_to_default state the Policy Engine Shall:

indicate to the Device Policy Manager that the Sink Shall transition to default 

request a reset of the local hardware

request the Device Policy Manager that the Port Data Role is set to UFP.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Startup state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that the Sink has reached the default level.
8.3.3.3.10
  PE_SNK_Give_Sink_Cap State

On entry to the PE_SNK_Give_Sink_Cap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager 
for the current system capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall then request the Protocol Layer to send a 
Sink_Capabilities Message containing these capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall send:

A Sink_Capabilities Message when a Get_Sink_Cap Message is received or

An EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message when a EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

The Sink_Capabilities Message has been successfully sent.
8.3.3.3.11
  PE_SNK_EPR_Keep_Alive
On entry to the PE_SNK_EPR_Keep_Alive State the Policy Engine Shall send an EPR_KeepAlive Message and 
initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Ready state when:

A EPR_KeepAlive_Ack Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state when:

The SenderResponseTimer times out.
8.3.3.3.12
  PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap State

On entry to the PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send 
a get Source Capabilities Message in order to retrieve the Source Capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall 
send:

A Get_Source_Cap Message when the Device Policy Manager requests SPR capabilities or

An EPR_Get_Source_Cap Message when the Device Policy Manager requests EPR Capabilities.
The Policy Engine Shall then start the SenderResponseTimer.
