  Port Reported PDP Field
The Port Reported PDP field Shall track the amount of power the Port is offering in its Source_Capabilities 
Message or EPR_Source_Capabilities Message. The Port Reported PDP field May be dynamic or Static depending 
on the Port's other characteristics such as Managed/Guaranteed Capability, SPR/EPR Mode, its power policy etc.
Note:
The Port Reported PDP field is computed as the integer part of, the largest of the products of the voltage 
times current of the Fixed Supply PDOs returned in the Source_Capabilities Message or 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Messages.
