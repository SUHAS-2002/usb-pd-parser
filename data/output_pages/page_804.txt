  UFP Entering USB4 Mode (Wait)
This is an example of an Enter USB operation where the DFP requests [USB4] mode when this is not possible for 
the UFP at this time. Figure 8.121, "UFP Entering USB4 Mode (Wait)" shows the Messages as they flow across the bus 
and within the devices to accomplish the Enter USB process.
