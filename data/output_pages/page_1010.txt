Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Note:
EPR Managed Capability Ports when power constrained are defined to offer higher voltages at lower Port 
Present PDP (as per Table 10.13, "EPR Source Capabilities when Port Present PDP is less than Port 
Maximum PDP and using an EPR-capable cable") than the port's Port Maximum PDP (as per Table 10.12, 
"EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port Maximum PDP and using an EPR Capable Cable") because these 
voltages would otherwise be available if the Managed Capability Port power hadn't been constrained. 
Managed Capability Ports are required to be properly identified to the user based on the port's Port 
Maximum PDP.
In reference to Table 10.13, "EPR Source Capabilities when Port Present PDP is less than Port Maximum PDP and 
using an EPR-capable cable", Table 10.14, "EPR Source Examples when Port Present PDP is less than Port Maximum 
PDP" gives examples of which EPR Capabilities, in addition to the required SPR Fixed Supply PDOs and SPR AVS 
APDO, are Advertised based on Port Present PDP and the port's Port Maximum PDP.

1)
The Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise either RoundDown (PDP/voltage) or RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA.
2)
EPR Sources Shall reject any Request for more than the Advertised PDP, i.e., when output voltage and operating current requested in 
the Sink RDO is outside of the defined AVS voltage and current range represented by the Advertised PDP, the RDO will be rejected.
3)
EPR Sources May offer an (A)PDOs at this Port Present PDP. When offered, the Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall 
Advertise either RoundDown (PDP/Voltage) or RoundUp (PDP/Voltage) to the nearest 10mA.
4)
This EPR Fixed Supply voltage is only available if allowed by Table 10.12, "EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port Maximum 
PDP and using an EPR Capable Cable" based on the port’s PDP Rating.
5)
The Max Voltage for AVS is what is allowed by TTable 10.12, "EPR Source Capabilities based on the Port Maximum PDP and 
using an EPR Capable Cable" based on the port’s Port Maximum PDP.
6)
The current available based on AVS voltage is as indicated in this column. The current defined here is describing the top edge of the 
Valid Operating Region as illustrated in Figure 10.6, "Valid EPR AVS Operating Region". AVS APDO does not have a Maximum 
Current field so the maximum current has to be calculated from the PDP.
