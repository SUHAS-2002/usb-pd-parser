Sink Port
Port operating as a Sink.
Sink Standby
During Sink Standby the Sink reduces its current draw to iSnkStdby
Soft Reset
A process that resets the PD communications engine to its default state.
SOP
K-code marker used for communication between Port Partners. See also Start of Packet.
SOP Communication
Communication using SOP Packets also implies that an AMS is being followed.
SOP Packet
Any Power Delivery Packet which starts with an SOP.
SOP’ Communication
Communication with a Cable Plug using SOP’ Packets, also implies that an AMS is being followed.
SOP’ Packet
Any Power Delivery Packet which starts with an SOP’ used to communicate with a Cable Plug.
SOP’’ Communication
Communication with a Cable Plug using SOP’’ Packets, also implies that an AMS is being followed.
SOP’’ Packet
Any Power Delivery Packet which starts with an SOP’’ used to communicate with a Cable Plug 
when SOP’ Packets are being used to communicate with the other Cable Plug.
SOP’
SOP’’
K-code marker used for communication between a Port and a Cable Plug. See also Start of Packet.
SOP*
Used to generically refer to K-code markers: SOP, SOP’ and SOP’’. See also Start of Packet.
SOP* Communication
Communication using SOP* Packets, also implies an AMS is being followed.
SOP* Packet
A term referring to any Power Delivery Packet starting with either SOP, SOP’, or SOP’’.
Source
The Power Role a Port is operating in to supply power over VBUS; most commonly a USB Host or 
Hub downstream port.
Source Capabilities
Capabilities offered by a Source.
Source Port
Port operating as a Source.
Specification Revision
See Revision.
SPM
See System Policy Manager.
SPR
See Standard Power Range.
SPR AVS
An SPR Source whose output voltage can be adjusted to an operating voltage within its 
Advertised range. Unlike SPR PPS, it does not support current limit. The SPR AVS Capabilities are 
exposed by the SPR AVS APDO (see Section 6.4.1.2.4.2, "SPR Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO").
SPR AVS Mode
A SPR Source, currently operating in an SPR AVS Contract, is said to be operating in SPR AVS 
Mode.
SPR Capabilities
An SPR Capabilities Message (Source_Capabilities Message or Sink_Capabilities Message) has at 
least one Power Data Object for vSafe5V followed by up to 6 additional Power Data Objects.
SPR Contract
Explicit Contract Negotiated, in SPR Mode, based on SPR (A)PDOs.
SPR Mode
The classic mode of PD operation where Explicit Contracts are Negotiated using SPR (A)PDOs.
SPR (A)PDO
Fixed Supply PDO that offers up to 20V and no more than 100W.
Variable Supply PDO whose Maximum voltage offers up to 21V and no more than 100W.
Battery Supply PDO whose Maximum voltage offers up to 21V and no more than 100W.
Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) APDO whose Maximum voltage is up to 20V and no more than 
100W.
Programmable Power Supply (PPS) APDO whose Maximum voltage is up to 21V and no more 
than 100W.
SPR PPS
A power supply whose output voltage and output current can be programmatically adjusted in 
small increments over its Advertised range. It supports current limit unlike SPR AVS and EPR 
AVS. The Capabilities are exposed by the Programmable Power Supply APDOs (see Section 
6.4.1.2.4, "Augmented Power Data Object (APDO)").
SPR PPS Mode
A power supply, currently operating in an SPR PPS Contract, is said to be operating in SPR PPS 
Mode.
SPR Sink
A Sink which only supports SPR Mode and does not support EPR Mode.
SPR Sink Port
A Port exposed on an SPR Sink.
SPR Source
A Source which only supports SPR Mode and does not support EPR Mode.
