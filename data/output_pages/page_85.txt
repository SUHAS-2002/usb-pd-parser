Note:
PDUSB Devices, even if they have the physical form of a cable (e.g., AMAs), are still required to respond to 
SOP Packets.
5.6.1.2.2
  Start of Packet Sequence Prime (SOP')
The SOP’ ordered set is defined as: two Sync-1 K-codes followed by two Sync-3 K-codes (see Table 5.6, "SOP’ 
Ordered Set").
A VPD Shall have SOP’ Communication capability. A VPD and a Cable Plug capable of SOP’ Communications Shall 
only detect and communicate with Packets starting with SOP’.
A Port needing to communicate with a Cable Plug capable of SOP’ Communications, Attached between a Port Pair 
will be able to communicate using both Packets starting with SOP’ to communicate with the Cable Plug and starting 
with SOP to communicate with its Port Partner.
For a VPD or a Cable Plug supporting SOP’ Communications, if a Valid SOP’ is not detected (see Table 5.3, "Validation 
of Ordered Sets") then the whole transmission Shall be Discarded. For a Port supporting SOP’ Communications if a 
Valid SOP or SOP’ is not detected (see Table 5.3, "Validation of Ordered Sets") then the whole transmission Shall be 
Discarded. When there is no Explicit Contract or an Implicit Contract in place a Sink Shall Not send SOP’ Packets 
and Shall Discard all Packets starting with SOP’.
5.6.1.2.3
  Start of Packet Sequence Double Prime (SOP'')
The SOP’’ ordered set is defined as the following sequence of K-codes: Sync-1, Sync-3, Sync-1, Sync-3 (see Table 5.7, 
"SOP’’ Ordered Set").
A VPD Shall Not have SOP’’ Communication capability. A Cable Plug capable of SOP’’ Communication, Shall have a 
SOP’ Communication capability in the other Cable Plug. No cable Shall only support SOP’’ Communication. A Cable 
Plug to which SOP’’ Communication is assigned Shall only detect and communicate with Packets starting with SOP’’ 
and Shall Discard any other Packets.
A Port needing to communicate with such a Cable Plug, Attached between a Port Pair will be able to communicate 
using Packets starting with SOP’ and SOP’’ to communicate with the Cable Plugs and Packets starting with SOP to 
communicate with its Port Partner. A Port which supports SOP’’ Communication Shall also support SOP’ 
Communication and Shall co-ordinate SOP* Communication so as to avoid collisions. 
For the Cable Plug supporting SOP’’ Communication, if a Valid SOP’’ is not detected (see Table 5.3, "Validation of 
Ordered Sets") then the whole transmission Shall be Discarded. For the Port if a Valid SOP* is not detected (see 
Table 5.3, "Validation of Ordered Sets") then the whole transmission Shall be Discarded.
