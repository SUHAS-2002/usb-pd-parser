  Entering EPR Mode (Failure of VCONN Swap)
This is an example of an Enter EPR Mode operation where the Sink requests EPR Mode when this process fails due 
to a failure of the VCONN Swap process. Figure 8.14, "Entering EPR Mode (Failure of VCONN Swap)" shows the 
Messages as they flow across the bus and within the devices to accomplish the Enter EPR process.
