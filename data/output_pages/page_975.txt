 States and Status Reporting
9.1
  Overview
This chapter describes the Status reporting mechanisms for devices with data connections (e.g., D+/D- and or 
SSTx+/- and SSRx+/-). It also describes the corresponding USB state a device that supports USB PD Shall transition 
to as a result of changes to the USB PD state that the device is in. 
This chapter does not define the System Policy or the System Policy Manager. That is defined in [UCSI]. In addition, 
the Policies themselves are not described here; these are left to the implementers of the relevant products and 
systems to define.
All PD Capable USB (PDUSB) Devices Shall report themselves as self-powered devices (over USB) when plugged 
into a PD capable Port even if they are entirely powered from VBUS. However, there are some differences between 
PD and [USB 2.0] / [USB 3.2]; for example, the presence of VBUS alone does not mean that the device (Consumer) 
moves from the USB Attached State to the USB Powered State. Similarly, the removal of VBUS alone does not move 
the device (Consumer) from any of the USB states to the USB Attached State. See Section 9.1.2, "Mapping to USB 
Device States" for details.
PDUSB Devices Shall follow the PD requirements when it comes to suspend (see Section 6.4.1.2.1.2, "USB Suspend 
Supported"), configured, and operational power. The PD requirements when the device is configured or 
operational are defined in this section (see Table 9.4, "PD Consumer Port Descriptor"). 
Note:
The power requirements reported in the PD Consumer Port descriptor of the device Shall override the 
power draw reported in the bMaxPower field in the configuration descriptor. A PDUSB Device Shall 
report zero in the bMaxPower field after successfully negotiating a mutually agreeable Explicit Contract 
and Shall disconnect and re-enumerate when it switches operation back to operating in standard [USB 
2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2]. When operating in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB 
Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] mode it Shall report its power draw via the bMaxPower field.
Each Provider and Consumer will have their own Local Policies which operate between Port Partners. An example 
of a typical PD system is shown in Figure 9.1, "Example PD Topology". This example consists of a Provider, 
Consumer/Providers and Consumers connected together in a tree topology. Between directly connected devices 
there is both a flow of Power and also Communication consisting of both Status and Control information.
