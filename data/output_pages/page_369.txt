Table 7.10  Sequence Description for Increasing the Programmable Power Supply Voltage
Step
Source Port
Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to increase its 
output voltage. 
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
After sending the Accept Message, the Programmable 
Power Supply starts to increase its output voltage. 
The Programmable Power Supply new voltage set-
point Shall be reached by tPpsSrcTransLarge for 
steps larger than vPpsSmallStep or else by 
tPpsSrcTransSmall. The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it has reached the new 
set-point and whether VBUS is at the corresponding 
new level, or if the supply is operating in CL mode. 
The power supply status is passed to the Policy 
Engine.
4
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tPpsSrcTransSmall or 
tPpsSrcTransLarge of the end of the GoodCRC 
Message following the Accept Message.
The Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from 
the Source.
5
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer, evaluates the PS_RDY Message 
from the Source and tells the Device Policy Manager 
that the Source is operating at the new voltage set 
point (corresponding to vPpsNew).
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
