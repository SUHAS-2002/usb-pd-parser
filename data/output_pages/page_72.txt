Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
2.6.5.3
  Dual-Role Data Ports
Dual-Role Data Ports have the ability to operate as either a DFP or a UFP and to swap between the two Data Roles 
using Data Role Swap. 
Note:
Products can be Dual-Role Data Ports without being Dual-Role Power Ports that is they can switch 
logically between DFP and UFP Data Roles even if they are Source-only or Sink-only Ports.
2.6.6
  Cable and Connectors
The USB Power Delivery specification assumes certified USB cables and associated detection mechanisms as 
defined in the [USB Type-C 2.4] specification.
2.6.6.1
  USB-C Port Control
The USB-C® Port Control block provides mechanisms to:

Inform the Device Policy Manager of cable Attach/Detach events.

Inform Sink's Device Policy Manager of the Rp value.

Allow Source's Device Policy Manager to set the Rp value.
2.6.7
  Interactions between Non-PD, BC, and PD devices
USB Power Delivery only operates when two USB Power Delivery devices are directly connected. When a device 
finds itself a mixed environment, where the other device does not support the USB Power Delivery Specification, 
the existing rules on supplying vSafe5V as defined in the [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USBBC 1.2] or [USB Type-C 2.4] 
specifications are applied.
There are two primary cases to consider:

The USB Host (DFP/Source) is non-PD and as such will not send any Advertisements. An Attached PD 
Capable device will not see any Advertisements and operates using the rules defined in the [USB 2.0], 
[USB 3.2], [USBBC 1.2] or [USB Type-C 2.4] specifications.

The Device (UFP/Sink) is non-PD and as such will not see any Advertisements and therefore will not 
respond. The USB Host (DFP/Source) will continue to supply vSafe5V to VBUS as specified in the [USB 
2.0], [USB 3.2], [USBBC 1.2] or [USB Type-C 2.4] specifications.
2.6.8
  Power Rules
Power Rules define voltages and current ranges that are offered by compliant USB Power Delivery Sources and used 
by a USB Power Delivery Sink for a given value of PDP Rating. See Chapter 10 "Power Rules" for further details.
