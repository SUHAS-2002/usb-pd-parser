  Augmented Power Data Object (APDO)
The voltage fields define the output voltage range over which the power supply Shall be adjustable in 20mV steps 
in SPR PPS Mode and 100mV steps in both SPR AVS Mode and EPR AVS Mode. The Maximum Current field contains 
the current the Programmable Power Supply Shall be capable of delivering over the Advertised voltage range. See 
Section 7.1.3, "Types of Sources" for the electrical requirements of the power supply. 
6.4.1.2.4.1
  SPR Programmable Power Supply APDO
Table 6.13, "SPR Programmable Power Supply APDO – Source" below describes the SPR PPS (1100b) APDO for a 
Source operating in SPR Mode and supplying 5V up to 21V.
The PPS APDO is used primarily for Sink Directed Charge Directed Charge of a Battery in the Sink. When applying a 
current to the Battery greater than the cable supports, a high efficiency fixed voltage scaler May be used in the Sink 
to reduce the cable current.
6.4.1.2.4.1.1
  PPS Power Limited
When the PPS Power Limited bit is set, the SPR PPS Source Shall operate in the same way as if the PPS Power 
Limited bit is clear (see Section 7.1.4.2, "SPR Programmable Power Supply (PPS)" with the below exception:

May supply power that exceeds the Source's rated PDP within the Optional operating area in Figure 7.7, 
"SPR PPS Constant Power".
When the PPS Power Limited bit is cleared, the SPR PPS Source Shall deliver the Maximum Current field value up 
to the Maximum Voltage as Advertised in its APDO.
The SPR PPS Source Shall Not reject an RDO with an Operating Current field value that is less than or equal to the 
Maximum Current field value in the APDO even if the requested Operating Current field value is greater than the 
Source's PDP/requested Output voltage.
