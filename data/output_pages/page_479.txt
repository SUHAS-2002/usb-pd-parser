  EPR Explicit Contract Negotiation (Accept)
Figure 8.15, "Successful Fixed EPR Power Negotiation" illustrates an example of a successful Message flow while 
negotiating an Explicit Contract in EPR Mode. The Negotiation goes through several distinct phases:

The Source sends out its power Capabilities in an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message.

The Sink evaluates these Capabilities and, in the request phase, selects one power level by sending an 
EPR_Request Message.

The Source evaluates the request and accepts the request with an Accept Message.

The Source transitions to the new power level and then informs the Sink by sending a PS_RDY Message.

The Sink starts using the new power level.

the Source starts its keep alive timer

the Sink starts its request timer to send periodic EPR_KeepAlive Messages
