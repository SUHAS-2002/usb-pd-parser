Table 6.72, "Response to an incoming Message (except VDM)" and Table 6.73, "Response to an incoming VDM" 
summarize the responses that Shall be made to an incoming Message including VDMs.
A failure to see a GoodCRC Message in response to any Message within tReceive (after nRetryCount retries), when 
a Port Pair is Connected, is indicative of a communications failure resulting in a Soft Reset (see Section 6.6.9.1, 
"tSoftReset").
A Soft Reset Shall impact the USB Power Delivery layers in the following ways:

PHY Layer: Reset not required since the PHY Layer resets on each Packet transmission/reception.

Protocol Layer: Reset MessageIDCounter, RetryCounter and state machines.
