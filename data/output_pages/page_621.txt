Table 8.86, "Steps for Sink Alert to Source" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at each labeled 
step in Figure 8.59, "Sink Alert to Source" above.

1
The DPM indicates a Sink alert condition. The Policy 
Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form an Alert 
Message.
2
Protocol Layer creates the Alert Message and passes to 
PHY Layer.
3
PHY Layer receives the Alert Message and compares the 
CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Alert Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
4
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Alert 
Message to the Policy Engine that consumes it.
5
The Policy Engine informs the DPM.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the Alert 
Message was successfully sent.
