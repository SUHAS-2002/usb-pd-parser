  SPR Explicit Contract Negotiation (Accept)
Figure 8.5, "Successful Fixed, Variable or Battery SPR Power Negotiation" illustrates an example of a successful 
Message flow while negotiating an Explicit Contract in SPR Mode. The Negotiation goes through 5 distinct phases:

The Source sends out its power Capabilities in a Source_Capabilities Message.

The Sink evaluates these Capabilities, and, in the request, phase selects one power level by sending a 
Request Message.

The Source evaluates the request and accepts the request with an Accept Message.

The Source transitions to the new power level and then informs the Sink by sending a PS_RDY Message.

The Sink starts using the new power level.

For SPR PPS operation:

the Source starts its keep alive timer.

the Sink starts its request timer to send periodic Request Messages.
