Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
6.5.1.2
  Product ID (PID) Field
The PID field Shall contain the 16-bit Product ID (PID) assigned by the Source's vendor. Devices that have a USB 
data interface Shall report the same PID as the idProduct in the Standard Device Descriptor (see [USB 2.0] and 
[USB 3.2]).
6.5.1.3
  XID Field
The XID field Shall contain the 32-bit XID provided by the USB-IF to the vendor who in turns assigns it to a product. 
If the vendor does not have an XID, then it Shall return zero in this field (see [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2]).
6.5.1.4
  Firmware Version Field
The FW Version field Shall contain an 8-bit firmware version number assigned to the device by the vendor. 
6.5.1.5
  Hardware Version Field
The HW Version field Shall contain an 8-bit hardware version number assigned to the device by the vendor. 
6.5.1.6
  Voltage Regulation Field
The Voltage Regulation field contains bits covering Load Step Slew Rate and Magnitude. 
See Section 7.1.12.1, "Voltage Regulation Field" for further details.
6.5.1.6.1
  Load Step Slew Rate 
The Source Shall report its load step response capability in bits 0…1 of the Voltage Regulation bit field. 
6.5.1.6.2
  Load Step Magnitude
The Source Shall report its load step magnitude rate as a percentage of IoC in bit 2 of the Voltage Regulation field.
6.5.1.7
  Holdup Time Field
The Holdup Time field Shall contain the Source's holdup time (see Section 7.1.12.2, "Holdup Time Field").
6.5.1.8
  Compliance Field
The Compliance is Static and Shall contain the standards the Source is compliant with in SPR (see Section 7.1.12.3, 
"Compliance Field").
6.5.1.9
  Touch Current Field
The Touch Current field reports whether the Source meets certain leakage current levels and if it has a ground pin.
A Source Shall set the Touch Current bit (bit 0) when their leakage current is less than 65µA rms when Source's 
maximum capability is less than or equal to 30W, or when their leakage current is less than 100 µA rms when its 
power capability is between 30W and 100W. The total combined leakage current Shall be measured in accordance 
with [IEC 60950-1] when tested at 250VAC rms at 50 Hz. 
A Source with a ground pin Shall set the Ground pin bit (bit 1). 
A Source whose Ground pin is intended to be connected to a protective earth Shall set both bit1 and bit 2.
6.5.1.10
  Peak Current Field
The Peak Current1/Peak Current2/Peak Current3 fields Shall contain the combinations of Peak Current that the 
Source supports (see Section 7.1.12.4, "Peak Current").
Peak Current provides a means for Source report its ability to provide current in excess of the Negotiated amount 
for short periods. The Peak Current descriptor defines up to three combinations of% overload, duration and duty
