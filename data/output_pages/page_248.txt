Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10

VDEMs Shall only be used during Modal Operation in the context of an Active Mode i.e., only after the 
UFP has Ack'ed the Enter Mode Command can VDEMs be sent or received. The Active Mode and the 
associated VDEMs Shall use the same SVID.

VDEMs May be used with SOP* Packets.

When a DFP or UFP does not support VDEMs or does not recognize the VID it Shall return a 
Not_Supported Message.
Note:
Usage of VDEMs with Chunking is not recommended since this is less efficient than using Unstructured 
VDMs.
