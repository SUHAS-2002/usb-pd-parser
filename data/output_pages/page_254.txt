Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
A UUT Shall enter BIST Carrier Mode within tBISTCarrierMode of the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, 
corresponding to the received the BIST Message used to initiate the test, being transmitted by the PHY Layer. In 
BIST Carrier Mode when transmitting a continuous carrier signal transmission Shall start as soon as the UUT enters 
BIST Mode.
6.6.7.2
  BISTContModeTimer
The BISTContModeTimer is used by a UUT to ensure that a Continuous BIST Mode (i.e., BIST Carrier Mode) is exited 
in a timely fashion. A UUT that has been put into a Continuous BIST Mode Shall return to normal operation (either 
PE_SRC_Transition_to_default, PE_SNK_Transition_to_default, or PE_CBL_Ready) within tBISTContMode of 
starting to transmit a continuous carrier signal.
6.6.7.3
  tBISTSharedTestMode
tBISTSharedTestMode is used to define the maximum time that a UUT has to enter BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode 
when requested by a Tester. 
A UUT Shall enter BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode and send a new Source_Capabilities Message from all Ports 
within the Shared Capacity Group within tBISTSharedTestMode of the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, 
corresponding to the received the BIST Message used to initiate the test, being transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.8
  Power Role Swap Timers
6.6.8.1
  SwapSourceStartTimer
The SwapSourceStartTimer Shall be used by the New Source, after a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap, to ensure 
that it does not send Source_Capabilities Message before the New Sink is ready to receive the Source_Capabilities 
Message. The New Source Shall Not send the Source_Capabilities Message earlier than tSwapSourceStart after the 
last bit of the EOP of GoodCRC Message sent in response to the PS_RDY Message sent by the New Source indicating 
that its power supply is ready. The Sink Shall be ready to receive a Source_Capabilities Message tSwapSinkReady 
after having sent the last bit of the EOP of GoodCRC Message sent in response to the PS_RDY Message sent by the 
New Source indicating that its power supply is ready.
6.6.9
  Soft Reset Timers
6.6.9.1
  tSoftReset
A failure to see a GoodCRC Message in response to any Message within tReceive (after nRetryCount retries), when 
a Port Pair is Connected, is indicative of a communications failure. This Shall cause the Source or Sink to send a 
Soft_Reset Message, transmission of which Shall be completed within tSoftReset of the CRCReceiveTimer 
expiring.
6.6.9.2
  tProtErrSoftReset
If the Protocol Error occurs that causes the Source or Sink to send a Soft_Reset Message, the transmission of the 
Soft_Reset Message Shall be completed within tProtErrSoftReset of the EOP of the GoodCRC sent in response to 
the Message that caused the Protocol Error.
6.6.10
   Data Reset Timers
6.6.10.1
  VCONNDischargeTimer
The VCONNDischargeTimer is used by the Policy Engine in the DFP to ensure the UFP actively discharges VCONN in 
a timely manner to ensure the cable will restore Ra. Once the UFP has discharged VCONN below vRaReconnect (see 
[USB Type-C 2.4]) it sends a PS_RDY Message (see also Section 7.1.15, "VCONN Power Cycle").
If the DFP does not receive a PS_RDY Message from the UFP within tVCONNSourceDischarge of the last bit of the 
GoodCRC acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the Data_Reset Message, the VCONNDischargeTimer 
will time out and the Policy Engine Shall enter the ErrorRecovery State.
