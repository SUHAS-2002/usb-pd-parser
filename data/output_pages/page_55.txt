Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Page 55
This specification mandates that all Revision 3.x systems fully support Revision 2.0 operation. They must discover 
the supported Revision used by their Port Partner and any connected Cable Plugs and revert to operation using the 
lowest common Revision number (see Section 6.2.1.1.5, "Specification Revision"). 
This specification defines Extended Messages containing data of up to 260 bytes (see Section 6.2.1.2, "Extended 
Message Header"). These Messages can be larger than expected by existing PHY HW. To accommodate Revision 2.0 
based systems a Chunking mechanism is mandated such that Messages are limited to Revision 2.0 sizes unless it is 
discovered that both systems support the longer Message lengths.
This specification includes changes to the Vendor Data Objects (VDO) used in the discovery of passive/active 
marked cables and Alternate Mode Adapters (AMA) (see Section 6.4.4.2, "Structured VDM"). To enable systems to 
determine which VDO format is being used the Structured Vendor Defined Message (SVDM) Version number has 
been incremented to 2.x. Version numbers have also been incorporated into the VDOs themselves to facilitate 
future changes if these become necessary.

  USB Power Delivery Capable Devices
Some examples of USB Power Delivery capable devices can be seen in Figure 2.1, "Logical Structure of USB Power 
Delivery Capable Devices" (a USB Host, a USB Device, a Hub, and a Charger). These are given for reference only and 
are not intended to limit the possible configurations of products that can be built using this specification.
Figure 2.1 Logical Structure of USB Power Delivery Capable Devices
Each USB Power Delivery capable device is assumed to be made up of at least one Port. Providers are assumed to 
have a Source and Consumers a Sink. Each device contains one, or more, of the following components:

UFPs that:

Sink Power.

Communicate using SOP Packets.

Optionally Communicate using SOP’ Packets/SOP’’ Packets.

Optionally source power (a Dual-Role Power Device).

Optionally communicate via USB.

Optionally support Alternate Modes.
