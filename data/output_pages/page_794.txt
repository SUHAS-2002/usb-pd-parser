Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received BIST Message 
information to the Policy Engine that consumes it.
The Policy Engine goes into BIST Test Data Mode Mode 
where it sends no further Messages except for GoodCRC 
Messages in response to received Messages (see Section 
6.4.3.2, "BIST Test Data Mode").
15
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the BIST 
Message was successfully sent.
