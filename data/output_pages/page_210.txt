ii)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract.
7)
The Source Shall send the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 3 (Enter Succeeded) and Shall 
enter EPR Mode.
8)
If the Sink receives an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 3 (Enter Succeeded) it Shall enter 
EPR Mode, otherwise it Shall initiate a Soft Reset.
If the EPR Mode entry process successfully completes within tEnterEPR of the last bit of the GoodCRC Message sent 
in response to the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 1 (Enter), the Source Shall send an 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap. 
If the EPR Mode entry process has not been aborted or does not complete within tEnterEPR of the last bit of the 
GoodCRC Message sent in response to the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 1 (Enter), the Sink Shall 
initiate a Soft Reset. 
6.4.10.2
  Operation in EPR Mode
While operating in EPR Mode, the Source Shall only send EPR_Source_Capabilities Messages to Advertise its power 
Capabilities and the Sink Shall only respond with EPR_Request Messages to Negotiate Explicit Contracts. The 
EPR_Request Message May be for either an SPR or EPR (A)PDO.
If the Source sends a Source_Capabilities Message, that is not in response to a Sink Get_Source_Cap Message, the 
Sink Shall initiate a Hard Reset. If the Sink sends a Request Message, the Source Shall initiate a Hard Reset.
The Source Shall monitor the CC communications path to ensure that there is periodic traffic. The Sink Shall send 
an EPR_KeepAlive Message when it has not sent any Messages for more than tSinkEPRKeepAlive to ensure there 
is timely periodic traffic. If there is no traffic for more than tSourceEPRKeepAlive, the Source Shall initiate a Hard 
Reset.
6.4.10.3
  Exiting EPR Mode
6.4.10.3.1
  Commanded Exit
While in EPR Mode, either the Source or Sink May exit EPR Mode by sending an EPR_Mode Message with the Action 
field set to 5 (Exit).
The ports Shall be in an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO prior to the EPR Mode exit process by either:

The Source sending an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message with no EPR (A)PDO s (e.g., only SPR (A)PDO 
s) or

The Sink negotiating a new Explicit Contract with bit 31 in the RDO set to zero (e.g., only SPR (A)PDO s)).
The process to exit EPR Mode is a Non-interruptible multi-Message AMS and Shall follow these steps in order:
1)
The Port Partners Shall be in an Explicit Contract with an SPR (A)PDO.
2)
Either the Source or Sink Shall send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit) to exit 
the EPR Mode 
3)
The Source Shall send a Source_Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap of the GoodCRC Message 
in response to the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit).
4)
If the Sink does not receive a Source_Capabilities Message within tTypeCSinkWaitCap of the last bit of 
the GoodCRC Message in response to the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit), Sink 
Shall initiate a Hard Reset.
6.4.10.3.2
  Implicit Exit
EPR Mode Shall be exited as the side-effect of the Power Role Swap and Fast Role Swap processes. This is because 
at the end of these processes VBUS will be at vSafe5V and the Ports will be in an Implicit Contract. The New Source 
will then send a Source_Capabilities Message (not an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message) to begin the process of
