On entry to the PE_SRC_VDM_Identity_Request state the Policy Engine Shall send a Structured VDM Discover 
Identity Command request, Shall increment the DiscoverIdentityCounter and Shall start the 
VDMResponseTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_VDM_Identity_ACKed state when:

A Structured VDM Discover Identity ACK Command response is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_VDM_Identity_NAKed state when:

The Policy Engine Shall transition back to either the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities or PE_SRC_Discovery state when:

The Device Policy Manager has been informed.
8.3.3.25.3.3
  PE_SRC_VDM_Identity_NAKed State
On entry to the PE_SRC_VDM_Identity_NAKed state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of the
