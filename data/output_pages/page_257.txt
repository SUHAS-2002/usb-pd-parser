6.6.12.4
  tVDMBusy
The Initiator Shall wait at least tVDMBusy, after receiving a BUSY Command response, before repeating the 
Structured VDM request again.
6.6.13
  VCONN Timers
6.6.13.1
  VCONNOnTimer
The VCONNOnTimer is used during a VCONN Swap.
The VCONNOnTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Accept Message, is transmitted or received 
by the PHY Layer.
The VCONNOnTimer Shall be stopped when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the PS_RDY Message, is transmitted by the 
PHY Layer.
Prior to sending the PS_RDY Message, the Port Shall have turned VCONN On.
6.6.13.2
  tVCONNSourceOff
The tVCONNSourceOff time applies during a VCONN Swap. The initial VCONN Source Shall cease sourcing VCONN within 
tVCONNSourceOff of the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the PS_RDY Message, being 
transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.14
  tCableMessage
Ports compliant with Revision 3.x of the specification Shall Not wait tCableMessage before sending an SOP’ Packet 
or SOP’’ Packet even when communicating using [USBPD 2.0] with a Cable Plug. This specification defines Collision 
Avoidance mechanisms that obviate the need for this time.
Cable Plugs Shall only wait tCableMessage before sending an SOP’ Packet or SOP’’ Packet when operating at 
[USBPD 2.0]. When operating at Revisions higher than [USBPD 2.0] Cable Plugs Shall Not wait tCableMessage 
before sending an SOP’ Packet or SOP’’ Packet.
6.6.15
  DiscoverIdentityTimer
The DiscoverIdentityTimer is used prior to or during an Explicit Contract when discovering whether a Cable Plug 
is PD Capable using SOP’. When performing Cable Discovery during an Explicit Contract the Discover Identity 
Command request Shall be sent every tDiscoverIdentity. No more than nDiscoverIdentityCount Discover 
Identity Messages without a GoodCRC Message response Shall be sent. If no GoodCRC Message response is received 
after nDiscoverIdentityCount Discover Identity Command requests have been sent by a Port, the Port Shall Not 
send any further SOP’/SOP’’ Messages.
6.6.16
  Collision Avoidance Timers
6.6.16.1
  SinkTxTimer
The SinkTxTimer is used by the Protocol Layer in a Source to allow the Sink to complete its transmission before 
initiating an AMS. 
The Source Shall wait a minimum of tSinkTx after changing Rp from SinkTxOK to SinkTxNG before initiating an 
AMS by sending a Message.
A Sink Shall only initiate an AMS when it has determined that Rp is set to SinkTxOK.
