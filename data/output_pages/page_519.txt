16
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent.
The Policy Engine tells the DPM to perform a Data 
Reset.
19
The DPM indicates that the Data Reset process is 
complete.
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a Data_Reset_Complete Message. 
20
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
21
PHY Layer receives the Data_Reset_Complete 
Message and compares the CRC it calculated with the 
one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
22
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message to the Protocol Layer.
23
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received 
Data_Reset_Complete Message information to the 
Policy Engine that consumes it.
The Policy Engine informs the DPM that a 
Data_Reset_Complete Message has been received.
24
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
26
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
27
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message was successfully sent.
The Policy Engine informs the DPM that the 
Data_Reset_Complete Message was successfully sent.
The reset is complete as defined in Section 6.3.14, "Data_Reset Message" Step 5. Port Partners re-establish a USB data 
connection.
