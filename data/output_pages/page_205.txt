6.4.9
  EPR_Request Message
An EPR_Request Message Shall be sent by a Sink, operating in EPR Mode, to request power, typically during the 
request phase of a power Negotiation. The EPR_Request Message Shall be sent in response to the most recent 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message. The EPR_Request Message Shall return a Sink Request Data Object (RDO) that 
Shall identify the Power Data Object being requested followed by a copy of the Power Data Object being requested.
Note:
The requested Power Data Object May be either an EPR (A)PDO or SPR (A)PDO.
The EPR_Request Message Shall be as shown in Figure 6.32, "EPR_Request Message".
Figure 6.32 EPR_Request Message
The Source Shall verify the PDO in the EPR_Request Message exactly matches the PDO in the latest 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message pointed to by the Object Position field in the RDO. 
The Source Shall respond to an EPR_Request Message in the same manner as it responds to a Request Message with 
an Accept Message, or a Reject Message (see Section 6.9, "Accept, Reject and Wait"). The Explicit Contract 
Negotiation process for EPR is the same as the process for SPR Mode except that the Source_Capabilities Message 
is replaced by the EPR_Source_Capabilities and the Request Message is replaced by the EPR_Request Message.
An EPR Source operating in SPR Mode that receives a EPR_Request Message Shall initiate a Hard Reset.
The RDO takes a different form depending on the kind of power requested. The PDO and APDO formats are detailed 
in Section 6.4.2, "Request Message".
