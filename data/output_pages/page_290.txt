6.12.2.2.2.1
  PRL_Tx_Src_Sink_Tx State
In the PRL_Tx_Src_Sink_Tx state the Source sets Rp to SinkTxOK allowing the Sink to start an Atomic Message 
Sequence (AMS). 
The Protocol Layer in a Source Shall transition from the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state to the 
PRL_Tx_Src_Sink_Tx state when:

A notification is received from the Policy Engine that the end of an AMS has been reached.
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Src_Sink_Tx state the Protocol Layer Shall request the PHY Layer to Rp to SinkTxOK.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state when:

Rp has been set.
6.12.2.2.2.2
  PRL_Tx_Src_Source_Tx State
In the PRL_Tx_Src_Source_Tx state the Source sets Rp to SinkTxNG allowing the Source to start an Atomic Message 
Sequence (AMS). 
The Protocol Layer in a Source Shall transition from the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state to the 
PRL_Tx_Src_Source_Tx state when:

A notification is received from the Policy Engine that an AMS will be starting.
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Src_Source_Tx state the Protocol Layer Shall set Rp to SinkTxNG.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Src_Pending state when:

A Message request is received from the Policy Engine.
6.12.2.2.2.3
  PRL_Tx_Src_Pending State
In the PRL_Tx_Src_Pending state the Protocol Layer has a Message buffered ready for transmission. 
On entry to the PRL_Tx_Src_Pending state the SinkTxTimer Shall be initialized and run.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Construct_Message state when:

The pending Message request from the Policy Engine is not a Soft_Reset Message and

The SinkTxTimer times out.
The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Layer_Reset_for_Transmit state when:

The pending Message request from the Policy Engine is a Soft_Reset Message and

The SinkTxTimer times out.
