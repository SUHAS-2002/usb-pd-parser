Additionally, USB Power Delivery devices which can operate as USB devices can communicate over USB (see Figure 
2.4, "USB Power Delivery Communication Over USB"). An Optional System Policy Manager (see Chapter 9 and [UCSI]) 
that resides in the USB Host communicates with the PDUSB Device over USB, via the root Port and potentially 
manages the individual Port to Port connections over a tree of USB Hubs. The Device Policy Manager interacts with 
the USB interface in each device to provide and update PD related information in the USB domain. 
Note:
A PD device is not required to have a USB device interface.
