PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
17
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
18
The Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter. It informs the Policy Engine that 
the EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message was 
successfully sent. The Protocol Layer stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
19
If the Source is not the VCONN Source the Source initiates the VCONN Swap process as described in Section 8.3.2.10, 
"VCONN Swap".
20
The Source performs Cable Discovery to determine whether the cable supports EPR. The Cable Discovery process 
is described in Section 8.3.2.14.1, "Discover Identity".
21
The Source is now the VCONN Source and has determined 
that the Sink and the cable are EPR Capable.
The Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form a 
EPR_Mode (Enter Succeeded) Message.
22
Protocol Layer creates the EPR_Mode (Enter Succeeded) 
Message and passes to PHY Layer.
23
PHY Layer receives the EPR_Mode (Enter Succeeded) 
Message and compares the CRC it calculated with the one 
sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the EPR_Mode 
(Enter Succeeded) Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
24
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
EPR_Mode (Enter Succeeded) Message to the Protocol 
Layer. 
25
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer passes the EPR_Mode (Enter 
Succeeded) information to the Policy Engine. The 
Policy Engine stops the SinkEPREnterTimer.
26
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
27
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
28
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
29
The Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter. It informs the Policy Engine that 
the EPR_Mode (Enter Succeeded) Message was 
successfully sent. The Protocol Layer stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
