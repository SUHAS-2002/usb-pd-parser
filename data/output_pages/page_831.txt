On entry to the PE_SRC_Ready state if this is a VCONN Source which needs to establish communication with a Cable 
Plug, the Policy Engine Shall:

Initialize and run the DiscoverIdentityTimer (no GoodCRC Message response yet received to Discover 
Identity Message).
On entry to the PE_SRC_Ready state if the current Explicit Contract is for an SPR PPS APDO, then the Policy Engine 
Shall do the following: 

Initialize and run the SourcePPSCommTimer.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Ready state if the current Explicit Contract is for EPR Mode, then the Policy Engine Shall do 
the following:

Initialize and run the SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer.
On exit from the PE_SRC_Ready, if the Source is initiating an AMS, then the Policy Engine Shall notify the Protocol 
Layer that the first Message in an AMS will follow.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that Source Capabilities have changed or

A Get_Source_Cap Message is received, and the Source is in SPR Mode or

An EPR_Get_Source_Cap Message is received, and the Source is in EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Negotiate_Capability state when:

A Request Message is received, and the Source is in SPR Mode or

An EPR_Request Message is received, and the Source is in EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Get_Sink_Cap state when:

The Device Policy Manager asks for the Sink Capabilities.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

The Source is operating as an SPR PPS and the SourcePPSCommTimer Timer times-out or

The Source is in EPR Mode and the SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer Timer times-out.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_EPR_Keep_Alive state when:

An EPR_KeepAlive Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Give_Source_Cap State when:

In EPR Mode and a Get_Source_Cap Message is received or

In SPR Mode and an EPR_Get_Source_Cap Message is received.
8.3.3.2.7
  PE_SRC_Disabled State
In the PE_SRC_Disabled state the PD Source supplies default power and is unresponsive to USB Power Delivery 
messaging, but not to Hard Reset Signaling.
8.3.3.2.8
  PE_SRC_Capability_Response State
The Policy Engine Shall enter the PE_SRC_Capability_Response state if there is a Request received from the Sink 
that cannot be met based on the present capabilities. When the present Explicit Contract is not within the present 
capabilities it is regarded as Invalid and a Hard Reset will be triggered.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send one of the 
following:
