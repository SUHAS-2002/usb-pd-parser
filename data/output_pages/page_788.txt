Table 8.142, "Steps for Initiator to Responder Attention" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at 
each labeled step in Figure 8.115, "Initiator to Responder Attention" above.

Step

Initiator
1
The DPM requests attention. The Policy Engine tells 
the Protocol Layer to form an Attention Command 
request.
2
Protocol Layer creates the Attention Command request 
and passes to PHY Layer.
3
PHY Layer receives the Attention Command request 
and compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Attention 
Command request. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
4
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Attention 
Command request information to the Policy Engine 
that consumes it.
5
The Policy Engine informs the DPM
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Attention Command request was successfully sent.
