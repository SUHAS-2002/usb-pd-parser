Table 7.13  Sequence Description for decreasing the Current in PPS mode
Step
Source Port
Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to decrease its 
set-point for the current limit.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then evaluates the Accept 
Message and instructs the Sink to reduce its current to 
below the new Negotiated current level and starts the 
PSTransitionTimer.
3
The Power Supply decreases its Current Limit set-
point to the new Negotiated value.
The Sink reduces its current to less than the new 
Negotiated current to prevent the Source from going 
into Current Limit.
4
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tPpsSrcTransSmall of the end of 
the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message.
5
Policy Engine receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message.
6
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the PS_RDY 
Message.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
7
The Sink is allowed to draw INEW but must be aware 
the voltage on VBUS can drop doing so.
