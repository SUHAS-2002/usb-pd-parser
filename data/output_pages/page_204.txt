Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
6.4.8.1
  USB Mode Field
The USB Mode field Shall be used by the DFP to direct the USB Mode the Port Partner is to enter.
6.4.8.2
  USB4® DRD Field
The USB4 DRD field Shall be set when the Host DFP is capable of operating as a [USB4] Device. A [USB4] Host DFP 
that sets the USB4 DRD field Shall also be capable of operating as a [USB 2.0] Device.
6.4.8.3
  USB3 DRD Field
The USB3 DRD field Shall be set when the Host DFP is capable of operating as a [USB 3.2] Device. A [USB 3.2] Host 
DFP that sets the USB3 DRD field Shall also be capable of operating as a [USB 2.0] Device.
6.4.8.4
  Cable Speed Field
The Cable Speed field Shall be used to indicate the cable's maximum speed. The value is read from the Cable Plug 
and interpreted by the DFP as defined by [USB Type-C 2.4] in the USB4 Discovery and Entry Section.
6.4.8.5
  Cable Type Field
The Cable Type field Shall be used to indicate whether the cable is passive or active. Further if the cable is active, 
it indicates the type of active circuits in the cable and if the cable is optically isolated. The value is read from the 
Cable Plug and interpreted by the DFP as defined by [USB Type-C 2.4] in the USB4 Discovery and Entry Section.
6.4.8.6
  Cable Current Field
The Cable Current field Shall be used to indicate the cable's current carrying capability. The value is reported by 
the Cable Plug in the VBUS Current Handling Capability (Passive Cable)/VBUS Current Handling Capability 
(Active Cable) field.
6.4.8.7
  PCIe Support Field
The PCIe Support field Shall be set when the Host DFP is capable of tunneling PCIe over [USB4].
The PCIe Support field May be set speculatively when the Hub's DFP is capable of tunneling PCIe over [USB4].
6.4.8.8
  DP Support Field
The DP Support field Shall be set when the Host DFP is capable of tunneling DP over [USB4].
The DP Support field May be set speculatively when the Hub's DFP is capable of tunneling DP over [USB4].
6.4.8.9
  TBT Support Field
The TBT Support field Shall be set when the Host DFP is capable of tunneling ThunderboltTM over [USB4] and that 
the Connection Manager (CM) supports discovery and configuration of Thunderbolt 3 devices connected to the 
DFP of [USB4] Hubs.
The TBT Support field May be set speculatively when the Hub's DFP is capable of tunneling Thunderbolt over 
[USB4].
6.4.8.10
  Host Present Field
The Host Present field Shall be set to indicate that a Host is present upstream.
