5.6.1.2.4
  Start of Packet Sequence Prime Debug (SOP'_Debug)
The SOP’_Debug ordered set is defined as the following sequence of K-codes: Sync-1, RST-2, RST-2, Sync-3 (see 
Table 5.8, "SOP’_Debug Ordered Set"). The usage of this Ordered Set is presently undefined.
5.6.1.2.5
  Start of Packet Sequence Double Prime Debug (SOP''_Debug)
The SOP’’_Debug ordered set is defined as the following sequence of K-codes: Sync-1, RST-2, Sync-3, Sync-2 (see 
Table 5.9, "SOP’’_Debug Ordered Set"). The usage of this Ordered Set is presently undefined.
5.6.1.3
  Packet Payload
The Packet data is delivered from the Protocol Layer (see Section 6.2, "Messages") and Shall be encoded with the 
hex data codes from Table 5.1, "4b5b Symbol Encoding".
5.6.1.4
  CRC
The CRC Shall be inserted just after the Payload. It is described in Section 5.6.2, "CRC".
5.6.1.5
  End of Packet (EOP)
The end of Packet marker Shall be a single EOP K-code as defined in Figure 5.1, "Interpretation of ordered sets". This 
Shall mark the end of the CRC. After the EOP, the CRC-residual Shall be checked. If the CRC is not good, the whole 
transmission Shall be Discarded, if it is good, the Packet Shall be delivered to the Protocol Layer.
Note:
An EOP May be used to prematurely terminate a Packet e.g., before sending Hard Reset Signaling.
5.6.2
  CRC
The Message Header and data Shall be protected by a 32-bit CRC. 

CRC-32 protects the data integrity of the data Payload. CRC-32 is defined as follows: 

The CRC-32 polynomial Shall be = 04C1_1DB7h. 

The CRC-32 Initial value Shall be = FFFF_FFFFh. 

CRC-32 Shall be calculated for all bytes of the Payload not inclusive of any Packet framing symbols (i.e., 
excludes the Preamble, SOP*, EOP).

CRC-32 calculation Shall begin at byte 0, bit 0 and continue to bit 7 of each of the bytes of the Packet.

The remainder of CRC-32 Shall be complemented.

The residual of CRC-32 Shall be C704 DD7Bh.
