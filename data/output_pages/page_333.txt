Scenarios where vSrcSlewNeg and vPpsSlewNeg VBUS slew rate limits do not apply and VBUS May transition faster 
than specified are as follows:

When discharging VBUS to vSafe0V during a Hard Reset.

When discharging VBUS to vSafe0V as part of a Power Role Swap to Sink Power Role.

When discharging VBUS to vSafe0V after a Detach.

During a Fast Role Swap when the VBUS power source connected to the Hub UFP stops sourcing power.

  UFP VCONN Power Cycle
The Data Reset process requires the DFP to be the VCONN Source by the end of the process. In the case where the 
UFP is the VCONN Source, the following steps Shall be followed:

Following the last bit of the GoodCRC Message acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the 
Data_Reset Message, the UFP Shall turn off VCONN and ensure it is below vRaReconnect (see [USB Type-
C 2.4]) within tVCONNZero.

When VCONN is below vRaReconnect, the UFP Shall send a PS_RDY Message.
Note:
If the UFP was not sourcing VCONN, it still sends the PS_RDY Message. 

The DFP Shall wait tVCONNReapplied following the last bit of the GoodCRC Message acknowledging the 
PS_RDY Message before sourcing VCONN. The DFP Shall ensure VCONN is within vVCONNValid (see [USB 
Type-C 2.4]) within tVCONNValid.
Figure 7.19, "Data Reset UFP VCONN Power Cycle" below illustrates the UFP VCONN Power Cycle process.
