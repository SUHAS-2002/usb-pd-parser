  Dual-Role (Source Port) Get Source Capabilities Extended State 
Diagram
Figure 8.184, "Dual-Role (Source) Get Source Capabilities Extended State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a 
Dual-Role device, presently operating as a Source, on receiving a request from the Device Policy Manager to get the 
Port Partner's extended Source Capabilities. See also Section 6.5.1, "Source_Capabilities_Extended Message".

  PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Cap_Ext State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state, from the PE_SRC_Ready state, due 
to a request to get the remote extended Source Capabilities from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall send a Get_Source_Cap_Extended 
Message and initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
On exit from the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of 
the outcome (capabilities or response timeout).
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SRC_Ready state (see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State Diagram") 
when:

A Source_Capabilities_Extended Message is received

Or SenderResponseTimer times out.
