  Increasing the Current Only
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when increasing the 
current without changing the voltage is shown in Figure 7.29, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Current". The 
sequence that Shall be followed is described in Table 7.8, "Sequence Description for Increasing the Current". The 
timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink 
Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.29, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Current", the Sink has previously sent a Request 
Message to the Source.
