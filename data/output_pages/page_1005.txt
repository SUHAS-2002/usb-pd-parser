  Optional Voltages/Currents
10.2.3.1
  Optional Normative Fixed, Variable and Battery Supply
In addition to the voltages and currents specified in Section 10.2.2, "Normative Voltages and Currents", an SPR 
Source that is optimized for use with a specific Sink or a specific class of Sinks May Optionally supply additional 
voltages and increased currents. However, the Optional voltages Shall Not exceed 9V.
Optional voltages Shall Not be implemented on EPR Source including for both SPR Mode and EPR Modes of 
operation. EPR versions of Variable Supply and Battery Supply PDOs are not defined and Shall Not be implemented, 
however SPR Variable Supply and Battery Supply PDOs are allowed in EPR Mode.
While allowed, the use of Optional voltages and currents is not recommended as two Sources with the same PDP 
Rating but not supporting the same Optional voltages and currents can behave differently thus confusing the user.
See Section 10.2, "Source Power Rules" for the rules that Shall apply to Optional PDOs in order to be consistent with 
the declared PDP Rating and the Normative voltages and currents.
10.2.3.2
  Optional Normative SPR Programmable Power Supply
The voltages and currents a Programmable Power Supply with a PDP Rating of x Watts Shall support are as defined 
Table 10.10, "SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP".
When Optional Programmable Power Supply APDOs are offered, the following requirements Shall apply:

A Source that Advertises Optional Programmable Power Supply APDOs Shall Advertise the PDOs and 
APDOs shown in Table 10.10, "SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port 
Maximum PDP".

A Source Shall Advertise Optional Programmable Power Supply APDOs with Maximum Voltage and 
Minimum Voltages for nominal voltage as defined in Table 10.11, "SPR Programmable Power Supply 
Voltage Ranges". 

A Source Shall Not Advertise a Programmable Power Supply APDO that does not follow the Minimum 
Voltage and Maximum Voltage defined in Table 10.11, "SPR Programmable Power Supply Voltage 
Ranges".

In no case Shall a Source Advertise a current that exceeds the Attached cable's current rating.

The Max Voltage Shall Not exceed 21V while in SPR Mode.
