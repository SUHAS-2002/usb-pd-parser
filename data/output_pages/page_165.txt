Page 165
Section Table 6.30, "Structured VDM Commands" shows the Commands, which SVID to use with each Command and 
the SOP* values which Shall be used.
6.4.4.2.1
  SVID
The Standard or Vendor ID (SVID) field Shall contain either a 16-bit USB Standard ID value (SID) or the 16-bit 
assigned to the vendor by the USB-IF (VID). No other value Shall be present in this field.
Section Table 6.31, "SVID Values" lists specific SVID values referenced by this specification.
6.4.4.2.2
  VDM Type
The VDM Type field Shall be set to one indicating that this is a Structured VDM.
6.4.4.2.3
  Structured VDM Version
The Structured VDM Version (Major)/Structured VDM Version (Minor) fields indicate the level of functionality 
supported in the Structured VDM part of the specification. This is not the same Version as the Version of this 
specification. The Structured VDM Version (Major) Shall be set to 01b to indicate Version 2.x with the Structured 
VDM Version (Minor) field set as appropriate based on whether the Port is implemented to USB PD Revision 3.1, 
Version 1.6 (or newer) or a prior Version.
To ensure interoperability with existing PDUSB products, PDUSB products Shall support every Structured VDM 
Version number starting from Version 1.0.
On receipt of a VDM Header with a higher Version number than it supports, a Port or Cable Plug Shall respond using 
the highest Version number it supports. On receipt of a VDM Header with a lower Version number than it supports, 
a Port or Cable Plug Shall respond using the same Version number it received.
The Structured VDM Version (Major)/Structured VDM Version (Minor) fields of the Discover Identity Command 
sent and received during the Discovery Process Shall be used to determine the lowest common Structured VDM 
Version supported by the Port Partners or Cable Plug and Shall continue to operate using this Specification Revision 
until they are Detached. After discovering the Structured VDM Version, the Structured VDM Version (Major)/
Structured VDM Version (Minor) fields Shall match the agreed common Structured VDM Version.
