  Dual-Role Sink Get Sink Capabilities from a Dual-Role Source
Figure 8.67, "Dual-Role Sink Gets Dual-Role Source's Capabilities as a Sink" shows an example sequence between a 
Dual-Role Power Source and a Dual-Role Power Sink when the Dual-Role Power Sink gets the Dual-Role Power Source 
Capabilities as a Sink.
