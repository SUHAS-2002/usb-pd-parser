 Physical Layer

  Physical Layer Overview
The Physical Layer (PHY Layer) defines the Signaling technology for USB Power Delivery. This chapter defines the 
electrical requirements and parameters of the PHY Layer required for interoperability between PDUSB Devices.
5.2
  Physical Layer Functions
The USB PD PHY Layer consists of a pair of transmitters and receivers that communicate across a single signal wire 
(CC). All communication is half duplex. The PHY Layer practices Collision Avoidance to minimize communication 
errors on the channel.
The transmitter performs the following functions:

Receive Packet data from the Protocol Layer.

Calculate and append a CRC.

Encode the Packet data including the CRC (i.e., the Payload).

Transmit the Packet (Preamble, SOP*, Payload, CRC and EOP) across the channel using Bi-phase Mark 
Coding (BMC) over CC.
The receiver performs the following functions:

Recover the clock and lock onto the Packet from the Preamble.

Detect the SOP*.

Decode the received data including the CRC.

Detect the EOP and validate the CRC:

If the CRC is Valid, deliver the Packet data to the Protocol Layer. 

If the CRC is Invalid, flush the received data.
