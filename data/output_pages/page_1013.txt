  Sink Power Rules
10.3.1
  Sink Power Rule Considerations
The Sink Power Rules are designed to ensure the best possible user experience when a given Sink used with a 
compliant Source of arbitrary Output Power Rating that only supplies the Normative voltages and currents. 
The Sink Power Rules are based on the following considerations:

Low power Sources (e.g., 5V) are expected to be very common and will be used with Sinks designed for 
a higher PDP. 

Optimizing the user experience when Sources with a higher PDP Rating are used with low power Sinks.

Preventing Sinks that only function well (or at all) when using Optional voltages and currents.
10.3.2
  Normative Sink Rules
Sinks designed to use Sources with a PDP Rating of x W Shall:

Either operate or charge from Sources that have a PDP Rating ≥ x W.

Either operate, charge or indicate a Capabilities Mismatch (see Section 6.4.2.3, "Capability Mismatch") 
from Sources that have a PDP Rating < x W and ≥ 0.5W.
A Sink optimized for a Source with Optional voltages and currents or power as described in Section 10.2.3, "Optional 
Voltages/Currents" with a PDP Rating of x W Shall provide a similar user experience when powered from a Source 
with a PDP Rating of ≥ x W that supplies only the Normative voltages and currents as specified in Section 10.2.2, 
"Normative Voltages and Currents". For example, a 60W Source might not offer 9V Prog or 15V Prog since 20V Prog 
is a suitable substitute for both (as shown in Table 10.10, "SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based 
on the Port Maximum PDP").
The Operational Current/Power in the Sink Capabilities PDO for Sinks with an Operational PDP of x Watts Shall be 
as follows:

Operational current for Fixed Supply/Variable Supply PDOs: RoundDown(x/voltage) to the nearest 
10mA.

Operational power for Battery Supply PDOs: ≤ x.

Operational current for Programmable Power Supply APDOs as defined in Table 10.10, "SPR 
Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP": RoundDown (x/Prog 
Voltage) to the nearest 50mA.
The Maximum Current/Power in the Sink RDO for Sinks with an Operational PDP of x Watts and Maximum PDP of y 
Watts Shall be as follows:

Maximum current for Fixed Supply/Variable Supply RDOs from Sinks without a Battery: RoundDown(x/
voltage) to the nearest 10mA.

Maximum current for Fixed Supply/Variable Supply RDOs from Sinks with a Battery: RoundDown(y/
Voltage) to the nearest 10mA.

Maximum power for Battery Supply RDOs from Sinks without a Battery: ≤ x.

Maximum power for Battery Supply RDOs from Sinks with a Battery: ≤ y.

Maximum current for PPS Supply RDOs from Source PDOs as defined in Table 10.10, "SPR 
Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP" or Table 10.14, "EPR 
Source Examples when Port Present PDP is less than Port Maximum PDP": RoundDown (y/Prog Voltage) 
to the nearest 50mA.
The following requirements Shall apply to the Advertised Sink Capabilities:
