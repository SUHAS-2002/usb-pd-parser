7.3.1.3.5
  Same Request Programmable Power Supply (PPS)
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when the Sink requests 
the same voltage and current levels as the present Negotiated levels for voltage and current is shown in Figure 7.35, 
"Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage in PPS mode". The sequence that Shall be followed is 
described in Table 7.14, "Sequence Description for no change in Current or Voltage in PPS mode". The timing 
parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink 
Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.35, "Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage in PPS mode", the Sink has previ-
ously sent a Request Message to the Source.
