
Reject Message - if the request cannot be met or the present Explicit Contract is Invalid.

Wait Message - if the request could be met later from the Power Reserve. A Wait Message Shall Not be 
sent if the present Explicit Contract is Invalid.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Ready state when:

There is an Explicit Contract and

A Reject Message has been sent and the present Explicit Contract is still Valid or

A Wait Message has been sent.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

There is an Explicit Contract and

The Reject Message has been sent and the present Explicit Contract is Invalid (i.e., the Sink had to 
request a new value so instead we will return to USB Default Operation).
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Wait_New_Capabilities state when:

There is no Explicit Contract and

A Reject Message has been sent or

A Wait Message has been sent.

  PE_SRC_Hard_Reset State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state from any state when:

Hard Reset request from Device Policy Manager or

In EPR Mode and a Request Message is received or

EPR Capable and in SPR Mode and an EPR_Request Message is received.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall: 

request the generation of Hard Reset Signaling by the PHY Layer

initialize and run the NoResponseTimer.
Note:
The NoResponseTimer Shall continue to run in every state until it is stopped or times out.

initialize and run the PSHardResetTimer and increment the HardResetCounter.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Transition_to_default state when:

The PSHardResetTimer times out.
8.3.3.2.10
  PE_SRC_Hard_Reset_Received State
The Policy Engine Shall transition from any state to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset_Received state when:

Hard Reset Signaling is detected.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset_Received state the Policy Engine Shall:

initialize and run the PSHardResetTimer

initialize and run the NoResponseTimer.
Note:
The NoResponseTimer Shall continue to run in every state until it is stopped or times out.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Transition_to_default state when:
