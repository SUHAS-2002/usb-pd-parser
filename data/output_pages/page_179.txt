6.4.4.3.1.7
  Active Cable VDOs
An Active Cable has a USB Plug on each end at least one of which is a Cable Plug supporting SOP’ Communication. 
An Active Cable Shall incorporate data bus signal conditioning circuits and May have a concept of Super Speed 
Directionality on its Super Speed wires. An Active Cable May include a VBUS wire.
An Active Cable:

Shall respond to SOP’ Communication.

May respond to SOP’’ Communication.

Shall support the Structured VDM Discover Identity Command.

In the Discover Identity Command ACK:

Shall set the Product Type in the ID Header VDO to Active Cable.

Shall return the Active Cable VDOs defined in Table 6.42, "Active Cable VDO1" and Table 6.43, "Active 
Cable VDO2"..
