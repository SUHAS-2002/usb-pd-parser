  Transitions
The following sections illustrate the power supply's response to various types of Negotiations. The Negotiations 
are triggered by certain Messages or Signaling. It provides examples of the transitions and is organized around each 
of the Messages and Signals that result in a response from the power supply. The response to a Message or Signal 
can result in different transitions depending upon the power supply's starting conditions and the requested 
change.

Transitions caused by a Request Message:

Generic transition between (A)PDO s:

Increase the current.

Increase the voltage.

Increase the voltage and the current.

Increase the voltage and decrease the current.

Decrease the voltage and increase the current.

Decrease the voltage and the current.

No change in Current or voltage.

Transitions within the same PDO (Fixed Supply, Battery Supply, Variable Supply):

Increase the current.

Decrease the current.

No change in current.

Transitions within the same PPS APDO:

Increasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) voltage.

Decreasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) voltage. 

Increasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Current.

Decreasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Current.

Same Request Programmable Power Supply (PPS).

Transitions within the same AVS APDO:

Increasing the Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) voltage

Decreasing the Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) voltage

Same Request Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) 

Transitions caused by the PR_Swap Message:

Source requests a Power Role Swap

Sink requests a Power Role Swap

Transitions caused by Hard Reset Signaling:

Source issues Hard Reset Signaling.

Sink issues Hard Reset Signaling.

Transitions caused by the Fast Role Swap Request:

Source asserts Rd at its preferred [USB Type-C 2.4] current.
