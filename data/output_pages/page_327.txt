7.1.8.3
  Programmable Power Supply Output Voltage Tolerance and 
Range
After a voltage transition of a Programmable Power Supply is complete (i.e. after tPpsSrcTransSmall or 
tPpsSrcTransLarge) and during static load conditions the Source output voltage Shall remain within the vPpsNew 
limits. The range defined by vPpsNew accounts for DC regulation accuracy, line regulation, load regulation and 
output ripple. After a voltage transition is complete (i.e. after tPpsSrcTransSmall or tPpsSrcTransLarge) and 
during transient load conditions the Source output voltage Shall Not go beyond the range specified by vPpsValid. 
The amount of time the Source output voltage can be in the band between vPpsNew and vPpsValid Shall Not 
exceed tPpsTransient.
7.1.8.4
  Adjustable Voltage Supply Output Voltage tolerance and Range
After a voltage transition of an AVS is complete (i.e. after tAvsSrcTransSmall or tAvsSrcTransLarge) and during 
static load conditions the Source output voltage Shall remain within the vAvsNew limits. The range defined by 
vAvsNew accounts for DC regulation accuracy, line regulation, load regulation and output ripple. After a voltage 
transition is complete (i.e. after tAvsSrcTransSmall or tAvsSrcTransLarge) and during transient load conditions 
the Source output voltage Shall Not go beyond the range specified by vAvsValid. The amount of time the Source 
output voltage can be in the band between vAvsNew and vAvsValid Shall Not exceed tAvsTransient.
