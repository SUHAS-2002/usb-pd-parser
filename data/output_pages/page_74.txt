Figure 2.6 Example of a Normal EPR Mode Operational Flow
Not illustrated in Figure 2.6, "Example of a Normal EPR Mode Operational Flow", while in EPR Mode operation, the 
Sink might decide it wants to exit EPR Mode. In this case, the Sink must initiate the exit process by revising its 
Explicit Contract with the Source at 20V or less followed with an EPR_Mode exit Message. Once EPR Mode is exited, 
a new SPR Contract is Negotiated to formalize the return to SPR Mode operation. Failure to revise the Explicit 
Contract to one at 20V or less before attempting to exit EPR Mode will result in a Hard Reset.
