
The Source receives a Request Message from the Sink and, if this is a Valid request, responds with 
an Accept Message followed by a PS_RDY Message when its power supply is ready to source power 
at the agreed level. At this point an Explicit Contract has been agreed.

A DFP that does not generate SOP’ Packets or SOP’’ Packets, is not required to detect SOP’ Packets or 
SOP’’ Packets and Discards them.

When in an Explicit Contract (PE_SRC_Ready State):

The Source processes and responds (if a response is required) to all Messages received and sends 
appropriate Messages whenever its Local Policy requires:

The Source informs the Sink whenever its Capabilities change, by sending a Source_Capabilities 
Message.

The Source responds to a Sink Request Message with the Capabilities mismatch bit set, by 
sending a Source_Capabilities Message with its maximum available power.

The Source will always have an Rp value asserted on its CC wire used for Collision Avoidance.

When this Port is a DRP the Source can initiate or receive a request for the exchange of Power 
Roles. After the Power Role Swap this Port will be a Sink and in an Implicit Contract until an 
Explicit Contract is Negotiated immediately afterwards.

When this Port is a DRD the Source can initiate or receive a request for an exchange of Data Roles. 
After a Data Role Swap the DFP (USB Host) becomes a UFP (USB Device). The Port remains a 
Source and the VCONN Source role remains unchanged.

The Source can initiate or receive a request for an exchange of VCONN Source role. During a VCONN 
Swap VCONN is applied by both Ports (make before break). The Port remains a Source and DFP/
UFP Data Roles remain unchanged.

The Source when it is the VCONN Source can communicate with a Cable Plug using SOP’ 
Communication or SOP’’ Communication at any time it is not engaged in any other SOP 
Communication:

If SOP Packets are received by the Source, during SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ Communication, 
the SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ Communication is immediately terminated (the Cable Plug 
times out and does not retry).

If the Source needs to initiate an SOP Communication during an ongoing SOP’ Communication or 
SOP’’ Communication (e.g., for a Capabilities change) then the SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ 
Communications will be interrupted. 

When the Source Port is also a DFP:

The Source can control the entry and exiting of Modes in the Cable Plug(s) and control Modal 
Operation.

The Source can initiate Unstructured VDMs or Structured VDMs.

The Source can control the entry and exiting of Modes in the Sink and control Modal Operation 
using Structured VDMs.

Detach or communications failure:

A Source detects plug Detach and takes VBUS down to vSafe5V within tSafe5V and vSafe0V within 
tSafe0V (i.e. using USB Type-C Detach detection via CC).

When the Source detects the failure to receive a GoodCRC Message in response to a Message within 
tReceive:

Leads to a Soft Reset, within tSoftReset of the CRCReceiveTimer expiring.
