  Sink Operation

At Attach (no PD Connection or Contract):

Sink detects Source Attachment through the presence of vSafe5V.

For a DRP that toggles between Source and Sink operation, the Port becomes a Sink Port on 
Attachment of a Source.

Once the Sink detects the presence of vSafe5V on VBUS it waits for a Source_Capabilities Message 
indicating the presence of a PD Capable Source.

If the Sink does not receive a Source_Capabilities Message within tTypeCSinkWaitCap then it can 
issue Hard Reset Signaling in order to cause the Source Port to send a Source_Capabilities Message 
if the Source Port is PD Capable.

The Sink does not generate SOP’ Packets or SOP’’ Packets, is not required to detect SOP’ Packets or 
SOP’’ Packets and Discards them.

Establishing PD Connection (no PD Connection or Contract):

The Sink receives a Source_Capabilities Message and responds with a GoodCRC Message.

The Sink does not generate SOP’ Packets or SOP’’ Packets, is not required to detect SOP’ Packets or 
SOP’’ Packets and Discards them.

Establishing the First Explicit Contract after an Attach, Hard Reset or Implicit Contract as a result of a 
Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap:

The Sink receives a Source_Capabilities Message from the Source and responds with a Request 
Message. If this is a Valid request the Sink receives an Accept Message followed by a PS_RDY Message 
when the Source's power supply is ready to source power at the agreed level. At this point the Source 
and Sink have entered into an Explicit Contract:

The Sink Port can request one of the Capabilities offered by the Source, even if this is the vSafe5V 
output offered by [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2], in order to enable 
future power Negotiation:

A Sink not requesting any Valid capability with a Request Message results in an error.

A Sink unable to fully operate at the offered Capabilities requests the default capability but in-
dicates that it would prefer another power level by setting the Capability Mismatch bit in the 
Request Message and also providing a physical indication of the failure to the end user (e.g., 
using an LED).

The Sink does not generate SOP’ Packets or SOP’’ Packets, is not required to detect SOP’ Packets or 
SOP’’ Packets and Discards them.

During PD Connection (Explicit Contract - PE_SNK_Ready state):

The Sink processes and responds (if a response is required) to all Messages received and sends 
appropriate Messages whenever its Local Policy requires.

A Sink whose power needs have changed indicates this to the Source with a new Request Message. 
The Sink Port can request one of the Capabilities previously offered by the Source, even if this is the 
vSafe5V output offered by [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2], in order to enable 
future power Negotiation:

Not requesting any capability with a Request Message results in an error.

A Sink unable to fully operate at the offered Capabilities requests an offered capability but 
indicates a Capabilities Mismatch i.e., that it would prefer another power level also providing a 
physical indication of the failure to the end user (e.g., using an LED).
