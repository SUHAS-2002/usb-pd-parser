Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Mode Entry
Process to start operation in a particular Mode.
Mode Exit
Process to end operation in a particular Mode.
Multi-Drop
PD is a Multi-Drop system sharing the Power Delivery communication channel between the Port 
Partners and the cable.
Negotiate
See Negotiation.
Negotiated
See Negotiation.
Negotiation
This is the PD process whereby:
1)
The Source Advertises its Capabilities.
2)
The Sink requests one of the Advertised Capabilities.
3)
The Source acknowledges the request, alters its output to satisfy the request and informs 
the Sink.
The result of the Negotiation is a Contract for power delivery/consumption between the Port 
Pair. 
New Sink
Sink at the end of a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap which has transition from being the Initial 
Source.
New Source
Source at the end of a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap which has transition from being the 
Initial Sink.
Non-interruptible
There cannot be any unexpected Messages during an AMS; it is therefore Non-interruptible. An 
AMS starts when the first Message in the AMS has been sent (i.e., a GoodCRC Message has been 
received acknowledging the Message). See Section 8.3.2.1.3, "Atomic Message Sequences".
OCP
Over-Current Protection.
OTP
Over-Temperature Protection.
OVP
Over-Voltage Protection.
Packet
One entire unit of PD communication including a Preamble, SOP*, Payload, CRC and EOP as 
defined in Section 5.6, "Packet Format".
Passive Cable
Cable with a USB plug on each end at least one of which is a Cable Plug supporting SOP’ that does 
not incorporate data bus signal conditioning circuits. Supports the Structured VDM Discover 
Identity to determine its characteristics (Electronically Marked Cable see [USB Type-C 2.4]).
Note: This specification does not discuss Passive Cables that are not Electronically Marked.
Passive Cable VDO
VDO defining the Capabilities of a Passive Cable.
Payload
Data content of a Packet, provided to/from the Protocol Layer.
PD
USB Power Delivery
PD Capable
A Port that supports USB Power Delivery.
PD Connection
See Connected.
PD Power
The output power, in Watts, of a Source, as specified by the manufacturer and expressed in Fixed 
Supply PDOs as defined in Section 10, "Power Rules".
PD SID
See USB-IF PD SID.
PDO
See Power Data Object.
PDP
See PD Power.
PDP Rating
The PDP Rating is the same as the Manufacturer declared PDP for a Source Port except where 
there is a fractional value, in which case the PDP Rating corresponds to the integer part of the 
Manufacturer declared PDP Rating (see Section 6.4.11.2, "Port Maximum PDP Field").
PDUSB
USB Device Port or USB Host Port that is both PD Capable and capable of USB Communication. See 
also PDUSB Host, PDUSB Device and PDUSB Hub.
PDUSB Device
A USB Device with a PD Capable UFP. A PDUSB Device is only addressed by SOP Packets.
PDUSB Host
A USB Host which is PD Capable on at least one of its DFPs. A PDUSB Host is only addressed by 
SOP Packets.
