  Basic Message Exchange
Figure 8.2, "Basic Message Exchange (Successful)" below illustrates how a Message is sent. Table 8.1, "Basic Message 
Flow" details the steps in the flow. Note that the sender might be either a Source or Sink while the receiver might 
be either a Sink or Source. The basic Message sequence is the same. It starts when the Message Sender's Protocol 
Layer at the behest of its Policy Engine forms a Message that it passes to the PHY Layer.

Step
Message Sender
Message Receiver
1
Policy Engine directs Protocol Layer to send a Message. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Message and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the Message 
to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
Protocol Layer forwards the received Message 
information to the Policy Engine that consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to the PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the Message and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
Protocol Layer checks and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer.
9
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Message was successfully sent.
