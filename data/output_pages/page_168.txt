6.4.4.3.1
  Discover Identity
The Discover Identity Command is provided to enable an Initiator to identify its Port Partner and for an Initiator 
(VCONN Source) to identify the Responder (Cable Plug or VPD). The Discover Identity Command is also used to 
determine whether a Cable Plug or VPD is PD-Capable by looking for a GoodCRC Message Response.
The Discover Identity Command Shall only be sent to SOP when there is an Explicit Contract.
The Discover Identity Command Shall be used to determine whether a given Cable Plug or VPD is PD Capable (see 
Section 8.3.3.21.1, "Initiator Structured VDM Discover Identity State Diagram" and Section 8.3.3.25.3, "Source Startup 
Structured VDM Discover Identity of a Cable Plug State Diagram"). In this case a Discover Identity Command request 
sent to SOP’ Shall Not cause a Soft Reset if a GoodCRC Message response is not returned since this can indicate a 
non-PD Capable cable or VPD.
Note:
A Cable Plug or VPD will not be ready for PD Communication until tVCONNStable after VCONN has been 
applied (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). 
During Cable Plug or VPD discovery, when there is an Explicit Contract, Discover Identity Commands are sent at a 
rate defined by the DiscoverIdentityTimer (see Section 6.6.15, "DiscoverIdentityTimer") up to a maximum of 
nDiscoverIdentityCount times (see Section 6.7.5, "Discover Identity Counter").
A PD-Capable Cable Plug or VPD Shall return a Discover Identity Command ACK in response to a Discover Identity 
Command request sent to SOP’.
The Discover Identity Command Shall be used to determine the identity and/or Capabilities of the Port Partner. 
The following products Shall return a Discover Identity Command ACK in response to a Discover Identity 
Command request sent to SOP:

A PD-Capable UFP that supports Modal Operation.

A PD-Capable product that has multiple DFPs.

A PD-Capable [USB4] product.
The SVID in the Discover Identity Command request Shall be set to the PD SID (see Section Table 6.31, "SVID 
Values").
The Number of Data Objects field in the Message Header in the Discover Identity Command request Shall be set 
to 1 since the Discover Identity Command request Shall Not contain any VDOs. 
The Discover Identity Command ACK sent back by the Responder Shall contain an ID Header VDO, a Cert Stat VDO, 
a Product VDO and the Product Type VDOs defined by the Product Type as shown in Figure 6.16, "Discover Identity 
Command response". This specification defines the following Product Type VDOs:

Passive Cable VDO (see Section 6.4.4.3.1.6, "Passive Cable VDO")

Active Cable VDOs (see Section 6.4.4.3.1.7, "Active Cable VDOs")

VCONN Powered USB Device (VPD) VDO (see Section 6.4.4.3.1.9, "VCONN Powered USB Device VDO")

UFP VDO (see Section 6.4.4.3.1.4, "UFP VDO")

DFP VDO (see Section 6.4.4.3.1.5, "DFP VDO")
No VDOs other than those defined in this specification Shall be sent as part of the Discover Identity Command 
response. Where there is no Product Type VDO defined for a specific Product Type, no VDOs Shall be sent as part of 
the Discover Identity Command response. Any additional VDOs received by the Initiator Shall be Ignored.
