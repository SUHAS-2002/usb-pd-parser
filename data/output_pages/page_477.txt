Table 8.41, "Steps for Entering EPR Mode (Failure of VCONN Swap)" below provides a detailed explanation of what 
happens at each labeled step in Figure 8.14, "Entering EPR Mode (Failure of VCONN Swap)" above.

1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate an EPR_Mode (Enter) Message to request 
entry to EPR Mode. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the EPR_Mode 
(Enter) Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the EPR_Mode (Enter) Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify 
the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the EPR_Mode 
(Enter) Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received EPR_Mode 
(Enter) Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
EPR_Mode (Enter) Message was successfully sent. The 
Policy Engine starts the SenderResponseTimer and 
the SinkEPREnterTimer.
10
Policy Engine evaluates the EPR_Mode (Enter) Message 
sent by the Sink. It tells the Protocol Layer to form a 
EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message.
11
Protocol Layer creates the EPR_Mode (Enter 
Acknowledged) Message and passes to PHY Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the EPR_Mode (Enter 
Acknowledged) Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the EPR_Mode 
(Enter Acknowledged) Message. Starts 
CRCReceiveTimer.
13
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
14
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer passes the EPR_Mode (Enter 
Acknowledged) information to the Policy Engine. The 
Policy Engine stops the SenderResponseTimer.
15
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
