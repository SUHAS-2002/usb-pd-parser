The Policy Engine directs the DPM to apply the Rp pull 
up.
Note: At some point (either before or after receiving 
the PS_RDY Message) the New Source has ap-
plied vSafe5V no later than tSrcFRSwap after 
detecting the Fast Role Swap Request and that 
VBUS has dropped below vSafe5V.
Policy Engine, when its power supply is ready to 
supply power, tells the Protocol Layer to form a PS_RDY 
Message. The Port Power Role Messageis set to Source.
29
Protocol Layer creates the PS_RDY Message and passes 
to PHY Layer.
30
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the PS_RDY 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
31
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the PS_RDY 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
32
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSSourceOnTimer.
33
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
34
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message. The Policy Engine resets the Protocol Layer.
35
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC to the Protocol Layer. 
36
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine resets the CapsCounter, resets the Protocol 
Layer and starts the SwapSourceStartTimer which 
must timeout before sending any Source_Capabilities 
Messages.
The Fast Role Swap is complete, the Power Roles have been reversed and the Port Partners are free to Negotiate for more 
power.
