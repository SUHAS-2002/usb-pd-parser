cSnkBulk
Sink bulk capacitance on VBUS at 
Attach and during FRS after the 
Initial Source stops sourcing and 
prior to establishing the First 
Explicit Contract (see Appendix E, 
"FRS System Level Example" for an 
example).1

1)
If more bypass capacitance than cSnkBulk max or cSnkBulkPd max is required in the device, then the device Shall 
incorporate some form of VBUS surge current limiting as described in [USB 3.2] Section 11.4.4.1.
