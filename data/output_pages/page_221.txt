  SOP Status Message
A Status Message, sent in response to Get_Status Message to SOP, enables a Port to inform its Port Partner about 
the present status of the Source or Sink. Typically, a Get_Status Message will be sent by the Port after receipt of an 
Alert Message. Some of the reported events are critical such as OCP, OVP and OTP, while others are informational 
such as change in a Battery's status from charging to neither charging nor discharging. 
The Status Message returns a 7-byte Status Data Block (SDB) whose format Shall be as shown in Figure 6.38, "SOP 
Status Message" and Table 6.55, "SOP Status Data Block (SDB)".
