4)
After a Power Swap the New Source is required to wait an additional tSwapSourceStart before sending a 
Source_Capabilities Message. This delay is not required when first starting up a system.
5)
PD Connected is defined as a situation when the Port Partners are actively communicating. The Port Partners remain PD 
Connected after a Swap until there is a transition to Disabled or the connector is able to identify a Detach. 
6)
Port Partners are no longer PD Connected after a Hard Reset, but consideration needs to be given as to whether there has 
been a PD Connection while the Ports have been Attached to prevent unnecessary USB Type-C Error Recovery.
7)
The DiscoverIdentityTimer is run when this is a VCONN Source and a PD Connection with a Cable Plug needs to be es-
tablished i.e. no GoodCRC Message has yet been received in response to a Discover Identity Command.
8)
See Section 5.7, "Collision Avoidance", Section 6.6.16, "Collision Avoidance Timers" and Section 6.10, "Collision Avoidance".
9)
In the PE_SRC_Wait_New_Capabilities State the Device Policy Manager Should either decide to send no further Source 
Capabilities or Should send a different set of Source Capabilities. Continuing to send the same set of Source Capabilities 
could result in a live lock situation.
10)
The SourcePPSCommTimer is only initialized and run when the present Explicit Contract is for an SPR PPS APDO. Sourc-
es that do not support SPR PPS do not need to implement the SourcePPSCommTimer.
11)
The SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer is only initialized and run when the Source is in EPR Mode; Sources that do not support 
EPR Mode do not need to implement the SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer.
12)
Either SPR or EPR Sink Capabilities May be requested, regardless of whether or not the Source is currently operating in 
SPR or EPR Mode.
8.3.3.2.1
  PE_SRC_Startup State
PE_SRC_Startup Shall be the starting state for a Source Policy Engine either on power up or after a Hard Reset. On 
entry to this state the Policy Engine Shall reset the CapsCounter and reset the Protocol Layer.
Note:
Resetting the Protocol Layer will also reset the MessageIDCounter and stored MessageID (see Section 
6.12.2.3, "Protocol Layer Message Reception").
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state:

When the Protocol Layer reset has completed if the PE_SRC_Startup state was entered due to the 
system first starting up.

When the SwapSourceStartTimer times out if the PE_SRC_Startup state was entered as the result of a 
Power Role Swap.
Note:
Sources Shall remain in the PE_SRC_Startup state, without sending any Source_Capabilities Messages 
until a plug is Attached.
8.3.3.2.2
  PE_SRC_Discovery State
On entry to the PE_SRC_Discovery state the Policy Engine Shall initialize and run the SourceCapabilityTimer in 
order to trigger sending a Source_Capabilities Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

The SourceCapabilityTimer times out and CapsCounter ≤ nCapsCount.
The Policy Engine May Optionally go to the PE_SRC_Disabled state when:

The Port Partners are not presently PD Connected

And the SourceCapabilityTimer times out 

And CapsCounter > nCapsCount.
The Policy Engine Shall go to the PE_SRC_Disabled state when:

The Port Partners have not been PD Connected (the Source Port remains Attached to a Port it has not 
had a PD Connection with during this Attachment)
