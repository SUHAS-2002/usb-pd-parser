a)
Verify the EPR Capable bit was set in the most recent RDO. If not set, the Source Shall do the 
following:
i)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and the Data field set to 
3 ("EPR Mode Capable bit not set in the RDO").
ii)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract.
b)
Verify the EPR Capable bit was set in the most recent 5V Fixed Supply PDO. If not set, the Source 
Shall do the following:
i)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and the Data field set to 
5 ("EPR Mode Capable bit not set in the Fixed Supply 5V PDO").
ii)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract.
c)
Verify the Source is still able to support EPR Mode. If not, the Source Shall do the following:
i)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and Data field set to 4 
("Unable at this time").
ii)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract. The Sink May 
at some time in the future send another request to enter EPR Mode.
d)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 2 (Enter Acknowledged).
3)
If the Sink receives any Message, other than an EPR_Mode Message with the Action Field set to 2, the 
Sink Shall initiate a Soft Reset.
4)
When the EPR Source has used the Discover Identity Command to determine and remembers the Cable 
Capabilities or the EPR Source is connected with a captive cable: 
a)
If the cable is EPR Capable it Should go directly to Step 7, but May continue to Step 5.
b)
If the cable is not EPR Capable it Shall do the following:
c)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and the Data field set to 
1 ("Cable not EPR capable").
d)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract.
5)
If the Source is not the VCONN Source, it Shall send a VCONN_Swap Message
a)
If the Source fails to become the VCONN Source, it Shall:
i)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and the Data field set to 
2 (not VCONN Source).
ii)
Abort the EPR Mode entry process and remain in the existing SPR Explicit Contract.
6)
The Source Shall use the Discover Identity Command to read the cable's e-Marker and verify the 
following:
a)
Cable VDO - Maximum VBUS Voltage (Passive Cable)/Maximum VBUS Voltage (Active Cable) 
field is 11b (50V)
b)
Cable VDO - VBUS Current Handling Capability (Passive Cable)/VBUS Current Handling 
Capability (Active Cable) field is 10b (5A)
c)
Cable VDO - EPR Capable (Passive Cable)/EPR Capable (Active Cable) field is 1b (EPR Capable)
d)
If the cable fails to respond to the Discover Identity Command or is not EPR Capable, the Source 
Shall do the following:
i)
Send an EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 4 (Enter Failed) and the Data field to1 
("Cable not EPR capable").
