Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Page 185
Explicit Contract where the absolute maximum voltage that can be applied to the cable is 21.55V. 
Maximum VBUS Voltage field values of 01b and 10b (formerly 30V and 40V) Shall be treated if they were 
00b (20V).
6.4.4.3.1.9.5
  VBUS Impedance Field
The VBUS Impedance field (B12…7) Shall contain the impedance the VPD adds in series between the Source and the 
Sink. The Sink Shall take this value into account when requesting current so as to not to exceed the VBUS IR Drop 
limit of 0.5V between the Source and itself. If the Sink can tolerate a larger IR Drop on VBUS it May do so. 
6.4.4.3.1.9.6
  Ground Impedance Field
The Ground Impedance field (B6…1) Shall contain the impedance the VPD adds in series between the Source and 
the Sink. The Sink Shall take this value into account when requesting current so as to not to exceed the Ground IR 
Drop limit of 0.25V between the Source and itself.
6.4.4.3.1.9.7
  Charge Through Field
The Firmware Version field (B0) Shall be set to 1b when the VPD supports Charge Through and 0b otherwise.
