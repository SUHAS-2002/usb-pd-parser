7.2.3.1
  Programmable Power Supply Sink Standby
A Sink is not required to transition to Sink Standby when operating within the Negotiated PPS APDO. A Sink May 
consume the Operating Current value in the PPS RDO during PPS output voltage changes. However, prior to 
operating the SPR PPS in Current Limit, the Sink Shall program the PPS Operating Voltage to the lowest practical 
level that satisfies the Sink load requirement. Doing so will minimize the inrush current that occurs when the 
transition to Current Limit occurs. When operating with an SPR PPS Source that is in Current Limit, the Sink Shall 
Not change its load in a manner that exceeds iPpsCLLoadStepRate or iPpsCLLoadReleaseRate. The load change 
magnitude Shall Not request a change to the Current Limit set-point that exceeds iPpsCLLoadStep.
If the Sink Negotiates for a new PPS APDO, that is expected to increase VBUS voltage, then the Sink Shall transition 
to Sink Standby while changing between PPS APDOs as described in Section 7.3.1, "Transitions caused by a Request 
Message".
7.2.4
  Suspend Power Consumption
When Source has set its USB Suspend Supported flag (see Section 6.4.1.2.1.2, "USB Suspend Supported"), a Sink Shall 
go to the lowest power state during USB suspend. The lowest power state Shall be pSnkSusp or lower for a PDUSB 
Peripheral and pHubSusp or lower for a PDUSB Hub. There is no requirement for the Source voltage to be changed 
during USB suspend.
7.2.5
  Zero Negotiated Current
When a Sink Requests zero current as part of a power Negotiation with a Source, the Sink Shall go to the lowest 
power state, pSnkSusp or lower, where it can still communicate using PD signaling.
7.2.6
  Transient Load Behavior
When a Sink's operating current changes due to a load step, load release or any other change in load level, the 
positive or negative overshoot of the new load current Shall Not exceed the range defined by iOvershoot. For the 
purposes of measuring iOvershoot the new load current value is defined as the average steady state value of the 
load current after the load step has settled. The rate of change of any shift in Sink load current during normal 
operation Shall Not exceed iLoadStepRate (for load steps) and iLoadReleaseRate (for load releases) as measured 
at the Sink receptacle.
The Sink's operating current Shall Not change faster than the value reported in the Source's Load Step Slew Rate 
in its Voltage Regulation bit field and Shall ensure that PD Communications meet the transmit and receive masks 
as specified in Section 5.8.2, "Transmit and Receive Masks".
7.2.7
  Swap Standby for Sinks
The Sink functionality in a Dual-Role Power Port Shall support Swap Standby. Swap Standby occurs for the Sink after 
evaluating the Accept Message from the Source during a Power Role Swap. While in Swap Standby the Sink's current 
draw Shall Not exceed iSnkSwapStdby from VBUS and the Dual-Role Power Port Shall be configured as a Source 
after VBUS has been discharged to vSafe0V by the existing Initial Source. The Sink's USB connection Should Not be 
reset even though vSafe5V is not present on the VBUS conductor (see Section 9.1.2, "Mapping to USB Device States"). 
The time for the Sink to transition to Swap Standby Shall be no more than tSnkSwapStdby. When in Swap Standby 
the Sink has relinquished its Power Role as Sink and will prepare to become the New Source. The transition time 
from Swap Standby to New Source Shall be no more than tNewSrc.
7.2.8
  Sink Peak Current Operation
Sinks Shall only make use of a Source overload capability when the corresponding Fixed Supply PDO Peak Current 
(see Section 6.4.1.2.1.8, "Peak Current") or AVS APDO Peak Current (see Section 6.4.1.2.4.3.2, "Peak Current") bits are 
set to 01b, 10b and 11b. Sinks Shall manage thermal aspects of the overload event by not exceeding the average 
Negotiated output of a Fixed Supply or AVS that supports Peak Current operation.
Sinks that depend on the Peak Current capability for enhanced system performance Shall also function correctly 
when Attached to a Source that does not offer the Peak Current capability or when the Peak Current capability has 
been inhibited by the Source.
