  Built in Self-Test (BIST)
The following sections define BIST functionality which Shall be supported.
5.9.1
  BIST Carrier Mode
In BIST Carrier Mode, the PHY Layer Shall send out a BMC encoded continuous string of alternating "1"s and "0"s. 
This enables the measurement of power supply noise and frequency drift. 
Note:
This transmission is a purely a sequence of alternating bits and Shall Not be formatted as a Packet. 
See also Section 6.4.3, "BIST Message". 
5.9.2
  BIST Test Data Mode
A BIST Test Data Message is used by the Tester to send various Tester generated Test Patterns to the UUT in order 
to test the UUT's receiver. See also Section 6.4.3, "BIST Message".
Figure 5.29, "Test Frame" shows the Test Frame which Shall be sent by the Tester to the UUT. The BIST Message, 
with a BIST Test Data BIST Data Object consists of a Preamble, followed by SOP*, followed by the Message Header 
with a data length of 7 Data Objects, followed a BIST Test Data BIST Data Object, followed by 6 Data Objects 
containing test data, followed by the CRC and then an EOP.
