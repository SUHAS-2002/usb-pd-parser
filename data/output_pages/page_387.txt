7.3.1.4.3
  Same Request Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Voltage
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when the Sink requests 
the same voltage and current levels as the present Negotiated levels for voltage and current as shown in Figure 
7.38, "Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage in AVS mode". The sequence that Shall be followed is 
described in Table 7.17, "Sequence Description for no change in Current or Voltage in AVS mode". The timing 
parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink 
Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters". 
Note:
In Figure 7.38, "Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage in AVS mode", the Sink has previ-
ously sent a Request Message to the Source.

1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then and starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tAvsSrcTransSmall of the end of 
the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message.
The Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from 
the Source.
4
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Note: The decision that no power transition is re-
quired could be made either by the Device Pol-
icy Manager or the power supply depending 
on implementation.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer, evaluates the PS_RDY Message 
from the Source. The Sink is already operating at the 
new power level, so no further action is required.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
