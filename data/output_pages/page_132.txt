
If an Accept Message is sent, the Source and Sink Shall do a Power Role Swap.

If a Reject Message is sent, the requester is informed that the recipient is unable, or unwilling, to do a 
Power Role Swap and no action Shall be taken.

If a Wait Message is sent, the requester is informed that a Power Role Swap might be possible in the 
future but that no immediate action Shall be taken.
The PR_Swap Message Shall Not be sent while in EPR Mode. While in EPR Mode if a Power Role Swap is required, 
an EPR Mode exit Shall be done first.
After a successful Power Role Swap the Port Partners Shall reset their respective Protocol Layers (equivalent to a 
Soft Reset): resetting their MessageIDCounter, RetryCounter and Protocol Layer state machines before attempting 
to establish the First Explicit Contract. At this point the New Source Shall also reset its CapsCounter. 
The New Source Shall have Rp asserted on the CC wire and the New Sink Shall have Rd asserted on the CC wire as 
defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. When performing a Power Role Swap from Source to Sink, the Port Shall change its CC 
wire resistor from Rp to Rd. When performing a Power Role Swap from Sink to Source, the Port Shall change its CC 
wire resistor from Rd to Rp. The DFP (Host), UFP (Device) Data Roles and VCONN Source Shall remain unchanged by 
the Power Role Swap process.
Note:
During the Power Role Swap process the Initial Sink does not disconnect even though VBUS drops below 
vSafe5V.

6.3.11
  VCONN_Swap Message
The VCONN_Swap Message Shall be supported by any Port that can operate as a VCONN Source.
The VCONN_Swap Message May be sent by either Port Partner to request an exchange of VCONN Source. The recipient 
of the Message Shall respond by sending an Accept Message, Reject Message, Wait Message (see Section 6.9, 
"Accept, Reject and Wait") or Not_Supported Message.

If an Accept Message is sent, the Port Partners Shall perform a VCONN Swap. The new VCONN Source Shall 
send a PS_RDY Message within tVcONNSourceOn to indicate that it is now sourcing VCONN. The initial 
VCONN Source Shall cease sourcing VCONN within tVCONNSourceOff of receipt of the last bit of the EOP of 
the PS_RDY Message.

If a Reject Message is sent, the requester is informed that the recipient is unable, or unwilling, to do a 
VCONN Swap and no action Shall be taken. A Reject Message Shall only be sent by the Port that is not 
presently the VCONN Source in response to a VCONN_Swap Message. The Port that is presently the VCONN 
Source Shall Not send a Reject Message in response to VCONN_Swap Message. 

If a Wait Message is sent, the requester is informed that a VCONN Swap might be possible in the future 
but that no immediate action Shall be taken.   A Port after losing the VCONN Source role due to incoming 
VCONN Swap request Shall Not initiate a VCONN Swap until at least tVCONNSwapDelayDFP/
tVCONNSwapDelayUFP after completing the previous VCONN Swap AMS.

If a Not_Supported Message is sent, the requester is informed that VCONN Swap is not supported. The 
Port that is not presently the VCONN Source May turn on VCONN when a Not_Supported Message is 
received in response to a VCONN_Swap Message.
