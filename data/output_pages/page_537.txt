  Source Initiated Power Role Swap (Accept)
This is an example of a successful Power Role Swap operation initiated by a Port which initially, at the start of this 
Message sequence, is acting as a Source and therefore has Rp pulled up on its CC wire. It does not include any 
subsequent Power Negotiation which is required in order to establish an Explicit Contract (see Section 8.3.2.2, 
"Power Negotiation").
There are four distinct phases to the Power Role Swap:

A PR_Swap Message is sent.

An Accept Message in response to the PR_Swap Message.

The New Sink sets its power output to vSafe0V, then asserts Rd and sends a PS_RDY Message when this 
process is complete.

The New Source asserts Rp, then sets its power output to vSafe5V and sends a PS_RDY Message when it 
is ready to supply power.
Figure 8.33, "Successful Power Role Swap Sequence Initiated by the Source" shows the Messages as they flow across 
the bus and within the devices to accomplish the Power Role Swap sequence.
