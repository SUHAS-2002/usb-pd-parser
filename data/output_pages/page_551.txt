Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares the 
CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine tells the power supply to stop supplying power.
19
The Policy Engine determines its power supply is no 
longer supplying VBUS. The Policy Engine requests the 
DPM to assert the Rd pull down on the CC wire. The 
Policy Engine then directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a PS_RDY Message, with the Port Power Role 
Messageset to Sink, to tell its Port Partner that it can 
begin to source VBUS.
20
Protocol Layer sets the Port Power Role Messageto Sink, 
creates the Message and passes to PHY Layer.
21
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and checks the 
CRC to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the PS_RDY Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
22
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the PS_RDY 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
23
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSSourceOffTimer, directs the DPM to apply the Rp 
pull up and then starts switching the power supply to 
vSafe5V Source operation.
24
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and checks 
the CRC to verify the Message.
26
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
27
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent. Policy Engine 
starts PSSourceOnTimer.
28
Policy Engine, when its power supply is ready to 
supply power, tells the Protocol Layer to form a PS_RDY 
Message. The Port Power Role Messageis set to Source.
29
Protocol Layer creates the PS_RDY Message and passes 
to PHY Layer.
