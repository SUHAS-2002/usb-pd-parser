Table 8.52, "Steps for a Soft Reset" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at each labeled step in 
Figure 8.25, "Soft Reset" above.
Table 8.52  Steps for a Soft Reset
Step
Reset Initiator
Reset Responder
1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a Soft_Reset Message to request a Soft Reset. 
2
Protocol Layer resets MessageIDCounter, stored 
MessageID and RetryCounter. Protocol Layer creates 
the Message and passes to PHY Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Soft_Reset 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Soft_Reset Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify 
the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Soft_Reset Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer does not check the MessageID in the 
incoming Message and resets MessageIDCounter, 
stored MessageID and RetryCounter.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Soft_Reset 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC 
to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Soft_Reset Message was successfully sent. Policy 
Engine starts SenderResponseTimer. 
10
Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form an Accept 
Message.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the Accept Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
13
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
14
The Protocol Layer forwards the received Accept 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
15
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
