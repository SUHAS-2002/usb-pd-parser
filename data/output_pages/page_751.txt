  Initiator to Responder Discover Identity (NAK)
Figure 8.103, "Initiator to Responder Discover Identity (NAK)" shows an example sequence between an Initiator and 
Responder, where both Port Partners are in an Explicit Contract and the Initiator attempts to discover identity 
information from the Responder but receives a NAK.
