  Product Type (Cable Plug)
The SOP’ Product Type (Cable Plug/VPD) field indicates the type of Product when the Product is a Cable Plug or VPD,

  Modal Operation Supported
The Modal Operation Supported bit is used to indicate whether or not the Product (either a Cable Plug or a device 
that can operate in the UFP role) is capable of supporting Modes. The Modal Operation Supported bit does not 
describe a DFP's Alternate Mode Controller functionality.
A product that supports Modal Operation Shall respond to the Discover SVIDs Command with a list of SVIDs for all 
of the Modes it is capable of supporting whether or not those Modes can currently be entered.

  Product Type (DFP)
The SOP - Product Type (DFP) field indicates the type of Product when in DFP Data Role, whether a VDO will be 
returned and if so the type of VDO to be returned. The Product Type indicated in the SOP - Product Type (DFP) field 
Shall be the closest categorization of the main functionality of the Product in DFP Data Role or "Undefined" when 
there is no suitable category for the product. For DRD Products this field Shall always indicate the Product Type 
when in DFP role regardless of the present Data Role. Table 6.36, "Product Types (DFP)" defines the Product Type 
VDOs which Shall be returned.
In SOP’ Communication (Cable Plugs and VPDs) this bit field is Reserved and Shall be set to zero.
