The Initiator of the Enter Mode Command request sends a Message Header with the Number of Data Objects field 
set to 2 indicating an additional VDO followed by a VDM Header with the Command Type (B7…6) set to zero 
indicating the Command is from an Initiator and the Command (B4…0) set to 4 to request the Responder to enter 
its mode of operation and sets the Object Position field to the desired functional VDO based on its offset as received 
during Discovery.
