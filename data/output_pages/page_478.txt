PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
17
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
18
The Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter. It informs the Policy Engine that 
the EPR_Mode (Enter Acknowledged) Message was 
successfully sent. The Protocol Layer stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
19
If the Source is not the VCONN Source the Source initiates the VCONN Swap process as described in Section 8.3.2.10, 
"VCONN Swap". In this case the VCONN Swap process fails.
20
The Source determines that there has been a failure or 
incompatibility during the EPR process (see Section 
6.4.10, "EPR_Mode Message").
The Policy Engine tells the Protocol Layer to form a 
EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) Message.
21
Protocol Layer creates the EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) 
Message and passes to PHY Layer.
22
PHY Layer receives the EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) 
Message and compares the CRC it calculated with the one 
sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the EPR_Mode 
(Enter Failed) Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
23
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) Message to the Protocol Layer. 
24
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer passes the EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) 
information to the Policy Engine. The Policy Engine 
stops the SinkEPREnterTimer.
25
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
26
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
27
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
28
The Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter. It informs the Policy Engine that 
the EPR_Mode (Enter Failed) Message was successfully 
sent. The Protocol Layer stops the CRCReceiveTimer.
