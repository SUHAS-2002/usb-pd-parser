2.8.3
  Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Charging Models
USB Power Delivery operating in SPR Mode (when PDP is higher than 27W) and EPR Mode includes support for 
Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) charging using a set of defined standard voltage ranges based on the Source's PDP 
Rating.
The standard voltage ranges available for AVS are summarized in Table 2.3, "AVS Voltage Power Ranges".

1)
Requires 5A cable.
2)
Requires an EPR Cable.

The maximum available SPR AVS current is determined by the maximum available current in the 
Fixed Supply 15V PDO in the 9 - 15V range and Fixed Supply 20V PDO in the 15 - 20V range.
