  Data Role Swap, Initiated by DFP Operating as Sink (Reject)
Figure 8.50, "Rejected Data Role Swap, DFP operating as Sink initiates" shows an example sequence between a Port, 
which is initially a UFP (Device) and a Source (Rp asserted), and a Port which is initially a DFP (Host) and a Sink (Rd 
asserted). A Data Role Swap is initiated by the DFP. During the process the Port Partners maintain their operation 
as either a Source or a Sink (power and Rp/Rd remain constant) and the exchange of Data Roles is rejected.
