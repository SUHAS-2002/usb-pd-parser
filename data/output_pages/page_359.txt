7.3.1.1.1.7
  No change in Current or Voltage
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when changing from 
one (A)PDO to another while the Sink requests the same voltage and Current as it is currently operating at is shown 
in Figure 7.28, "Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage". The sequence that Shall be followed is 
described in Table 7.7, "Sequence Description for no change in Current or Voltage". The timing parameters that Shall 
be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and 
Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.28, "Transition Diagram for no change in Current or Voltage", the Sink has previously sent a 
Request Message to the Source.
