  Hard Reset
The following sections describe the steps required for a USB Power Delivery Hard Reset. The Hard Reset returns 
the operation of the USB Power Delivery to default Power Role/Data Role and operating voltage/current. During 
the Hard Reset USB Power Delivery PHY Layer communications Shall be disabled preventing communication 
between the Port Partner.
Note:
Hard Reset, in this case, is applied to the USB Power Delivery capability of an individual Port on which 
the Hard Reset is requested. A side effect of the Hard Reset is that it might reset other functions on the 
Port such as USB.
