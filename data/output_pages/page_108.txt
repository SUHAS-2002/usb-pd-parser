  Inter-Frame Gap
Figure 5.26, "Inter-Frame Gap Timings" illustrates the inter-Frame gap timings.
Figure 5.26 Inter-Frame Gap Timings
The transmitter Shall drive the bus for no longer than tEndDriveBMC after transmitting the final bit of the Frame.
Before starting to transmit the next Frame's Preamble the transmitter of the next Frame Shall ensure that it waits 
for tInterFrameGap after either:

Transmitting the previous Frame, for example sending the next Message in an AMS immediately after 
having sent a GoodCRC Message, or 

Receiving the previous Frame, for example when responding to a received Message with a GoodCRC 
Message, or 

Observing an Idle condition on CC (see Section 5.7, "Collision Avoidance"). In this case the Port is waiting 
to initiate an AMS observes Idle (see Section 5.8.6.1, "Definition of Idle") and then waits tInterFrameGap 
before transmitting the Frame. See also Section 5.7, "Collision Avoidance" for details on when an AMS can 
be initiated.
Note:
The transmitter is also required to verify a bus Idle condition immediately prior to starting transmission 
of the next Frame (see Section 5.8.6.1, "Definition of Idle").
The transmitter of the next Frame May vary the start of the Preamble by tStartDrive (see Section 5.8.1, "Encoding 
and signaling").
See also Section 5.8.1, "Encoding and signaling" for figures detailing the timings relating to transmitting, receiving, 
and observing Idle in relating to Frames.
5.8.5.5
  Shorting of Transmitter Output
A Transmitter in a Port or Cable Plug Shall tolerate having its output be shorted to ground for tFRSwapTx max. 
This is due to the potential for Fast Role Swap to be signaled while the Transmitter is in the process of transmitting 
(see Section 5.8.5.6, "Fast Role Swap Transmission").
