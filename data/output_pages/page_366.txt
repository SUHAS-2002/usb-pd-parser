Table 7.9  Sequence Description for Decreasing the Current
Step
Source Port
Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to modify its 
output power. 
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message. Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to reduce 
power consumption.
3
The Sink Shall Not violate the transient load 
behavior defined in Section 7.2.6, "Transient Load 
Behavior" while transitioning to and operating at the 
new power level. The Sink Shall be able to operate 
with lower current within tSnkNewPower (t1); t1 
Shall complete before tSrcTransition.
4
tSrcTransition after the GoodCRC Message was 
received, the power supply starts to change its output 
power capability. The power supply Shall be ready to 
operate at the new power level within tSrcReady 
(t2). The power supply informs the Device Policy 
Manager that it is ready to operate at the new power 
level. The power supply status is passed to the Policy 
Engine.
5
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tSrcTransReq of the end of the 
GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message.
The Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from 
the Source.
6
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer, evaluates the PS_RDY Message 
from the Source and tells the Device Policy Manager 
that the Source is operating at the new (A)PDO.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
