Figure 7.12 Expected AVS/PPS Ripple Relative to an LSB
7.1.8.2
  AVS/PPS DNL Errors and Output Voltage/Current Tolerance
The PPS voltage and current discrete LSB steps have a DNL tolerance as shown in Figure 7.13, "Allowed DNL errors 
and tolerance of Voltage and Current in AVS/PPS mode" below. In absolute terms the step size of the LSB for both 
voltage and current is defined by vPpsStep/vAvsStep for voltage and iPpsCLStep for current. Several examples of 
Valid LSB steps are shown in Figure 7.13, "Allowed DNL errors and tolerance of Voltage and Current in AVS/PPS 
mode":

The upper end of the DNL error (+1 LSB) shows the case where one step is effectively skipped.

The lower end of the DNL error (-1 LSB) shows the case where the voltage or current set-point 
remained the same.
The ideal scenario for the DNL error (=0) matches the typical step size for the voltage or current.
The intent of DNL is to guarantee that changes to the voltage/current have the correct directionality, and that the 
maximum step size is clearly defined. 
Note:
The Source Should avoid scenarios where multiple consecutive steps have errors close to the Maximum 
and Minimum DNL.
