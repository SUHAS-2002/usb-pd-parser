Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that a RS_RDY 
has been received. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSTransitionTimer.
When in SPR PPS Mode the Policy Engine starts the 
SinkPPSPeriodicTimer.

The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
34
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
35
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. The Protocol Layer verifies and 
increments the MessageIDCounter. Stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
 
36
The Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent.

When in SPR PPS Mode the Policy Engine starts the 
SourcePPSCommTimer.
