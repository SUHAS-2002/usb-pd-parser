Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
SPR Managed Capability Ports when power constrained are defined to offer Valid (A)PDOs based on  the port's Port 
Maximum PDP (as per Table 10.2, "SPR Normative Voltages and Minimum Currents") at lower Port Present PDP 
(as per Table 10.3, "SPR Source Capabilities When Port Present PDP is less than Port Maximum PDP") because these 
voltages would otherwise be available if the Managed Capability Port power hadn't been constrained.

1)
Requires a 5A cable.
2)
The Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise at least 3A, but May Advertise up to RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA. Requires a 5A cable if over 3A is Advertised.
3)
The Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise either RoundDown (PDP/voltage) or RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA.
4)
SPR AVS current for this voltage range is the maximum current as Advertised by the 15V Fixed Supply PDO. This current can be higher 
than 3A (refer to Note 2). Requires a 5A cable if over 3A is Advertised.
5)
The Sink is allowed to request up to the 20V Fixed Supply Max Current when the requested voltage is 15.0V.
6)
The Max Voltage for SPR AVS is what is allowed by Table 10.2, "SPR Normative Voltages and Minimum Currents" based on the port's 
Port Maximum PDP.
7)
This SPR Fixed Supply voltage is only available if allowed by Table 10.2, "SPR Normative Voltages and Minimum Currents" based on the 
port's Port Maximum PDP.
8)
SPR Sources May offer (A)PDOs at this Port Present PDP
