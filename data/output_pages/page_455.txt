  SPR Explicit Contract Negotiation (Wait)
Figure 8.7, "Wait response to Fixed, Variable or Battery SPR Power Negotiation" illustrates an example of a Message 
flow where the request is responded to with wait while negotiating an Explicit Contract in SPR Mode. The 
Negotiation goes through the following phases:

The Source sends out its power Capabilities in a Source_Capabilities Message.

The Sink evaluates these Capabilities, and, in the request, phase selects one power level by sending a 
Request Message.

The Source evaluates the request and rejects the request with a Wait Message.
