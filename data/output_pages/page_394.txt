Table 7.19  Sequence Description for a Source Requested Power Role Swap
Step
Initial Source Port New Sink Port
Initial Sink Port  New Source Port
1
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Initial 
Source.
2
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to modify its 
output power. 
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Initial Source. Policy Engine starts the 
PSSourceOffTimer.
2a
The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy Manager to 
instruct the power supply to transition to Swap 
Standby. The power supply Shall complete the 
transition to Swap Standby within tSnkStdby (t1); t1 
Shall complete before tSrcTransition. The Sink Shall 
Not violate the transient load behavior defined in 
Section 7.2.6, "Transient Load Behavior" while 
transitioning to and operating at the new power level. 
When in Sink Standby the Initial Sink Shall Not draw 
more than iSnkSwapStdby (I1).
3
tSrcTransition after the GoodCRC Message was sent 
the power supply starts to change its output power 
capability to Swap Standby (see Section 7.1.10, "Swap 
Standby for Sources"). The power supply Shall 
complete the transition to Swap Standby within 
tSrcSwapStdby (t2). The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it is ready to operate as 
the New Sink. The CC termination is changed from Rp 
to Rd (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). The power supply 
status is passed to the Policy Engine.
4
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
device that will become the New Source, starting 
within tSrcTransOff of the end of the GoodCRC 
Message following the Accept Message.
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY. 
5
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the soon to be New Source. Policy Engine starts the 
PSSourceOnTimer. At this point the Initial Source is 
ready to be the New Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
New Sink.
Policy Engine then stops the PSSourceOffTimer and 
tells the Device Policy Manager to instruct the power 
supply to operate as the New Source.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before the 
PSSourceOffTimer times out the Sink starts sending 
Hard Reset Signaling.
6
The CC termination is changed from Rd to Rp (see 
[USB Type-C 2.4]). The power supply as the New 
Source transitions from Swap Standby to sourcing 
default vSafe5V within tNewSrc (t3). The power 
supply informs the Device Policy Manager that it is 
operating as the New Source.
7
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message.
Device Policy Manager informs the Policy Engine the 
power supply is ready, and the Policy Engine sends 
the PS_RDY Message to the New Sink, starting within 
tSrcTransOn of the end of the GoodCRC Message 
following the Accept Message.
