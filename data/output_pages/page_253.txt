The PSSourceOnTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the transmitted PS_RDY Message, is re-
ceived by the PHY Layer.

The PSSourceOnTimer Shall be stopped when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the received PS_RDY Message, is transmit-
ted by the PHY Layer.
The PSSourceOnTimer relates to the time taken for the remote Dual-Role Power Device to start sourcing power 
(see also Section 7.3.2.1, "Sink Requested Power Role Swap" and Section 7.3.2.2, "Source Requested Power Role Swap") 
and will time out if a PS_RDY Message indicating this has not been received within tPSSourceOn.
6.6.5.3.2
  Use during Fast Role Swap
The PSSourceOnTimer is used by the Policy Engine in Dual-Role Power Device that has just stopped sourcing power 
and is waiting to start sinking power to timeout on a PS_RDY Message during a Fast Role Swap. This condition leads 
to USB Type-C Error Recovery.
The PSSourceOnTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the transmitted PS_RDY Message, is re-
ceived by the PHY Layer.
The PSSourceOnTimer Shall be stopped when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the received PS_RDY Message, is transmit-
ted by the PHY Layer.
The PSSourceOnTimer relates to the time taken for the remote Dual-Role Power Device to start sourcing power 
(see also Section 7.2.10, "Fast Role Swap" and Section 7.3.4, "Transitions Caused by Fast Role Swap") and will time 
out if a PS_RDY Message indicating this has not been received within tPSSourceOn.
6.6.6
  NoResponseTimer
The NoResponseTimer is used by the Policy Engine in a Source to determine that its Port Partner is not responding 
after a Hard Reset. When the NoResponseTimer times out, the Policy Engine Shall issue up to nHardResetCount 
additional Hard Resets before determining that the Port Partner is non-responsive to USB Power Delivery 
messaging.
If the Source fails to receive a GoodCRC Message in response to a Source_Capabilities Message within tNoResponse 
of: 

The last bit of a Hard Reset Signaling being sent by the PHY Layer if the Hard Reset Signaling was initi-
ated by the Sink.

The last bit of a Hard Reset Signaling being received by the PHY Layer if the Hard Reset Signaling was 
initiated by the Source.
Then the Source Shall issue additional Hard Resets up to nHardResetCount times (see Section 6.8.3, "Hard Reset").
For a non-responsive device, the Policy Engine in a Source May either decide to continue sending 
Source_Capabilities Messages or to go to non-USB Power Delivery operation and cease sending 
Source_Capabilities Messages.
6.6.7
  BIST Timers
6.6.7.1
  tBISTCarrierMode
tBISTCarrierMode is used to define the maximum time that a UUT has to enter BIST Carrier Mode when requested 
by a Tester.
