7.1.8
  Output Voltage Tolerance and Range
After a voltage transition is complete (i.e., after tSrcReady) and during static load conditions the Source output 
voltage Shall remain within the vSrcNew or vSafe5V limits as applicable. The ranges defined by vSrcNew and 
vSafe5V account for DC regulation accuracy, line regulation, load regulation and output ripple. After a voltage 
transition is complete (i.e., after tSrcReady) and during transient load conditions the Source output voltage Shall 
Not go beyond the range specified by vSrcValid. The amount of time the Source output voltage can be in the band 
between either vSrcNew or vSafe5V and vSrcValid Shall Not exceed tSrcTransient. Refer to Table 7.23, "Source 
Electrical Parameters" for the output voltage tolerance specifications. Figure 7.11, "Application of vSrcNew and 
vSrcValid limits after tSrcReady" illustrates the application of vSrcNew and vSrcValid after the voltage transition is 
complete.
The vSrcNew and vSrcValid limits Shall Not apply to VBUS during the VBUS discharge and switchover that occurs 
during a Fast Role Swap as described in Section 7.1.13, "Fast Role Swap".

 The Source output voltage Shall be measured at the connector receptacle. The stability of the Source Shall be 
tested in 25% load step increments from minimum load to maximum load and also from maximum load to 
minimum load. The transient behavior of the load current is defined in Section 7.2.6, "Transient Load Behavior". The 
time between each step Shall be sufficient to allow for the output voltage to settle between load steps. In some 
systems it might be necessary to design the Source to compensate for the voltage drop between the output stage of 
the power supply electronics and the receptacle contact. The determination of whether compensation is necessary 
is left to the discretion of the Source implementation.

  AVS/PPS Output Voltage Ripple
The AVS/PPS output voltage ripple is expected to exceed the magnitude of one or more LSB as show in the Figure 
7.12, "Expected AVS/PPS Ripple Relative to an LSB".
