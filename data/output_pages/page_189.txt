Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10

On receiving an Enter Mode Command requests the Responder Shall respond with either an ACK or a NAK 
response. The Responder is not allowed to return a BUSY response. The value in the Object Position field of the 
Enter Mode Command response Shall contain the same value as the received Enter Mode Command request.
If the Responder responds to the Enter Mode Command request with an ACK, the Responder Shall enter the 
Alternate Mode before sending the ACK. The Initiator Shall enter the Alternate Mode on reception of the ACK. 
Successful transmission of the Message confirms to the Responder that the Initiator will enter an Active Mode.
See Figure 8.111, "DFP to UFP Enter Mode" for more details.
If the Responder responds to the Enter Mode Command request with a NAK, the Alternate Mode is not entered. If 
not presently in Modal Operation the Initiator Shall return to USB operation. If not presently in Modal Operation 
the Responder Shall remain in either USB operation or the USB Safe State.
If the Initiator fails to receive a response within tVDMWaitModeEntry it Shall Not enter the Alternate Mode but 
return to USB operation.
Figure 6.22, "Successful Enter Mode sequence" shows the sequence of events during the transition between USB 
operation and entering an Alternate Mode. It illustrates when the Responder's Alternate Mode changes and when 
the Initiator's Alternate Mode changes. Figure 6.23, "Unsuccessful Enter Mode sequence due to NAK" illustrates that 
when the Responder returns a NAK the transition to an Alternate Mode do not take place and the Responder and 
Initiator remain in their default USB roles.
