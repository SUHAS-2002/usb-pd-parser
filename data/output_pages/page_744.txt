PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
16
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
17
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Firmware_Update_Response Message was successfully 
sent.
The firmware update exchange is complete.
