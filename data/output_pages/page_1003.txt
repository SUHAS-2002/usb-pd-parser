  SPR Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS)
For SPR AVS, Figure 10.3, "Valid SPR AVS Operating Region for a Source advertising in the range of 27W < PDP ≤ 45W", 
Figure 10.4, "Valid SPR AVS Operating Region for a Source advertising in the range of 45W < PDP ≤ 60W" and Figure 
10.5, "Valid SPR AVS Operating Region for a Source advertising in the range of 60W < PDP ≤ 100W" illustrate the valid 
operating region for SPR AVS RDO requests in the ranges of 27W < PDP ≤ 45W, 45W < PDP ≤ 60W and 60W < PDP ≤ 
100W, respectively.
