  Multi-Drop
The BMC Signaling Scheme is suitable for use in Multi-Drop configurations containing one or two BMC Multi-Drop 
transceivers connected to the CC wire, where one or both ends of a cable contains a Multi-Drop transceiver. In this 
specification the location of the Multi-Drop transceiver is referred to as the Cable Plug.
Figure 5.27, "Example Multi-Drop Configuration showing two DRPs" below illustrates a typical Multi-Drop 
configuration with two DRPs.

The Multi-Drop transceiver Shall obey all the electrical characteristics specified in this section except for those 
relating to capacitance. The maximum capacitance allowed for the Multi-Drop node when not driving the line is 
cCablePlug_CC defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. There are no constraints as to the distance of the Multi-Drop 
transceiver from the end of the plug. The Multi-Drop transceiver(s) May be located anywhere along the cable 
including the plugs. The Multi-Drop transceiver suffers less from ground offset compared to the transceivers in the 
USB Host or USB Device and contributes no significant reflections.
It is possible to have a configuration at Attach where one Port can be a VCONN Source and the other Port is not able 
to be a VCONN Source, such that there is no switch in the second Port. An example of a DFP with a switch Attached 
to a UFP without a switch is outlined in Figure 5.28, "Example Multi-Drop Configuration showing a DFP and UFP". 
The capacitance on the CC line for a Port not able to be a VCONN Source Shall still be within cReceiver except when 
transmitting.
