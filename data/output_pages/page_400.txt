  Transitions Caused by Fast Role Swap
7.3.4.1
  Fast Role Swap
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed during a Fast Role Swap 
is shown in Figure 7.43, "Transition Diagram for Fast Role Swap". The parallel sequences that Shall be followed are 
described in Table 7.22, "Sequence Description for Fast Role Swap". The timing parameters that Shall be followed 
are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, 
"Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters". Negotiations between the New Source and the New Sink May occur 
after the New Source sends the final PS_RDY Message.
Note:
In Figure 7.43, "Transition Diagram for Fast Role Swap". and Table 7.22, "Sequence Description for Fast 
Role Swap" numbers are used to indicate Message related steps and letters are used to indicate other 
events.
