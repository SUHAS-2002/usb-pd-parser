12
The Protocol Layer informs the PHY Layer that the Hard 
Reset is complete.
The PHY Layer enables the PHY Layer communications 
channel for transmission and reception.
The reset is complete and protocol communication can restart.
13
Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to send a 
Source_Capabilities Message that represents the 
power supply’s present capabilities. Starts the 
SourceCapabilityTimer.
14
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
15
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the 
Source_Capabilities Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Source_Capabilities Message 
and checks the CRC to verify the Message.
16
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Source_Capabilities Message to the Protocol Layer.
17
Protocol Layer stores the MessageID of the incoming 
Message.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received 
Source_Capabilities Message information to the Policy 
Engine that consumes it.
18
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
19
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC Message and checks 
the CRC to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
20
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
21
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Source_Capabilities Message was successfully sent.
Policy Engine stops the SourceCapabilityTimer, stops 
the NoResponseTimer and starts the 
SenderResponseTimer. 
USB Power Delivery communication is re-established.
