6.6.16.2
  tSrcHoldsBus
If a transition into the PE_SRC_Ready state will result in an immediate transition out of the PE_SRC_Ready state 
within tSrcHoldsBus e.g. it is due to a Protocol Error that has not resulted in a Soft Reset, then the notifications of 
the end of AMS and first Message in an AMS May Not be sent to avoid changing the Rp value unnecessarily.
6.6.17
  Fast Role Swap Timers
6.6.17.1
  tFRSwap5V
The tFRSwap5V time Shall be measured from:

The later of:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Accept Message or

VBUS being within vSafe5V.

Until the first bit of the response PS_RDY Message Preamble has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
During a Fast Role Swap, the Initial Source Shall start the PS_RDY Message within tFRSwap5V after both:

The Initial Source has sent the Accept Message, and

VBUS is at or below vSafe5V.
6.6.17.2
  tFRSwapComplete
During a fast-role swap, the Initial Sink Shall respond with a the PS_RDY Message within tFRSwapComplete after 
it has received the PS_RDY Message from the Initial Source. The tFRSwapComplete time Shall be measured from 
the time the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the PS_RDY Message, has been transmitted by 
the PHY Layer until the first bit of the response PS_RDY Message Preamble has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.17.3
  tFRSwapInit
That last bit of the EOP of the FR_Swap Message Shall be transmitted by the New Source no later than tFRSwapInit 
after the Fast Role Swap Request has been detected (see Section 5.8.6.3, "Fast Role Swap Detection").
6.6.18
   Chunking Timers
6.6.18.1
  ChunkingNotSupportedTimer
The ChunkingNotSupportedTimer is used by a Source or Sink which does not support multi-chunk Chunking but 
has received a Message Chunk.
The ChunkingNotSupportedTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to a Message Chunk of a multi-chunk Message, 
is transmitted by the PHY Layer. The Policy Engine Shall Not send its Not_Supported Message before 
the ChunkingNotSupportedTimer expires.
6.6.18.2
  ChunkSenderRequestTimer
The ChunkSenderRequestTimer is used during a Chunked Message transmission.
The ChunkSenderRequestTimer Shall be used by the sender's Chunking state machine to ensure that a Chunk 
Response is responded to within a bounded time of tChunkSenderRequest. Failure to receive the expected 
response is detected when the ChunkSenderRequestTimer expires. 
The ChunkSenderRequestTimer Shall be started when:

The last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding to the Chunk Response Message, is received by 
the PHY Layer.
