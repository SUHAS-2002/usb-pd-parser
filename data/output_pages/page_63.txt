
A Sink operating in the SPR PPS Mode periodically sends Request Message within tPPSRequest even 
if its request is unchanged.

A Sink operating in the EPR Mode periodically communicates with the Source (i.e., sends an 
EPR_KeepAlive Message or any other Message) within tSourceEPRKeepAlive.

The Sink will always have Rd asserted on its CC wire.

When this Port is a DRP, the Sink can initiate or receive a request for the exchange of Power Roles. 
After the Power Role Swap this Port will be a Source and an Implicit Contract will be in place until an 
Explicit Contract is Negotiated immediately afterwards.

When this Port is a DRD the Sink can initiate or receive a request for an exchange of Data Roles. After 
a Data Role Swap the UFP (USB Device) becomes a DFP (USB Host). The Port remains a Sink and 
VCONN Source role (or not) remains unchanged.

The Sink can initiate or receive a request for an exchange of VCONN Source. During a VCONN Swap 
VCONN is applied by both ends (make before break). The Port remains a Sink and DFP/UFP Data Roles 
remain unchanged.

The Sink when it is the VCONN Source can communicate with a Cable Plug using SOP’ Communication 
or SOP’’ Communication at any time it is not engaged in any other SOP Communication:

If SOP Packets are received by the Sink, during SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ Communication, the 
SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ Communication is immediately terminated (the Cable Plug times 
out and does not retry)

If the Sink needs to initiate an SOP Communication during an ongoing SOP’ Communication or 
SOP’’ Communication (e.g., for a Capabilities change) then the SOP’ Communication or SOP’’ 
Communications will be interrupted. 

When the Sink Port is also a DFP:

The Sink can initiate Unstructured VDMs or Structured VDMs.

The Sink can control the Mode Entry and Mode Exit of Modes in the Source and control Modal 
Operation (e.g. [USB4]).

Detach or Communications Failure:

A Sink detects the removal of VBUS and interprets this as the end of the PD Connection:

This is unless the vSafe0V is due to either a Hard Reset, Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap.

A Sink detects plug removal (i.e., absence of Rp or VBUS) and discharges VBUS.

When the Sink detects the failure to receive a GoodCRC Message in response to a Message within 
tReceive:

Leads to a Soft Reset, within tSoftReset of the CRCReceiveTimer expiring.

If the Soft Reset process cannot be completed a Hard Reset will be issued within tHardReset of 
the CRCReceiveTimer to restore VBUS to USB Default Operation within ~1-1.5s.

Receiving no response to further attempts at communication is interpreted by the Sink as an 
error (see Error handling).

When the Sink operating in the SPR PPS Mode fails to send periodic communication (i.e. a Request 
Message) to the Source within tPPSRequest, the Source will issue a Hard Reset that results in VBUS 
going to vSafe5V.

When the Sink operating in the EPR Mode fails to send periodic communication (i.e. an 
EPR_KeepAlive Message or any other Message) to the Source within tSourceEPRKeepAlive the 
Source will issue a Hard Reset that results in VBUS going to vSafe5V.
