  Data Role Swap, Initiated by DFP Operating as Source (Wait)
Figure 8.48, "Data Role Swap with Wait, DFP operating as Source initiates" shows an example sequence between a 
Port, which is initially a UFP (Device) and a Sink (Rd asserted), and a Port which is initially a DFP and a Source (Rp 
asserted). A Data Role Swap is initiated by the DFP. During the process the Port Partners maintain their operation 
as either a Source or a Sink (power and Rp/Rd remain constant) and the exchange of Data Roles is delayed by wait.
