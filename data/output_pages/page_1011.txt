EPR Sources when operating in an AVS Explicit Contract are required to stay within their PDP as such they Shall 
respond to any request (VA) for more than the PDP with a Reject Message. Figure 10.6, "Valid EPR AVS Operating 
Region" illustrates the definition of the Valid operating range for an EPR Source operating in an AVS Explicit 
Contract based on its Advertised PDP.
Figure 10.6 Valid EPR AVS Operating Region
Figure 10.7, "EPR Source Power Rule Illustration for Fixed PDOs" illustrates the minimum current that an EPR Source 
Shall support at each voltage for a given PDP Rating.
Note:
Not illustrated are that currents higher than 3A are allowed to be offered up to a limit of 5A given that a 
5A cable is detected by the Source and the voltage times current remains within the Source PDP Rating.
