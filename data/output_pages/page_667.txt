  Dual-Role Sink Gets Sink Capabilities Extended from a Dual-Role 
Source
Figure 8.75, "Dual-Role Sink Gets Dual-Role Source's Extended Capabilities" shows an example sequence between a 
Source and a Sink when the Dual-Role Power Sink gets the Dual-Role Power Source's Extended Capabilities as a Sink.
