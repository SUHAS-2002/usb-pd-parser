  Initiator to Responder Discover Modes (BUSY)
Figure 8.110, "Initiator to Responder Discover Modes (BUSY)" shows an example sequence between an Initiator and 
Responder, where both Port Partners are in an Explicit Contract and the Initiator attempts to discover Mode 
information from the Responder but receives a BUSY.
