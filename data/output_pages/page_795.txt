  BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode
The following is an example of a BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode test between a Tester and a UUT. When the UUT 
is connected to the Tester the sequence below is executed. 
Figure 8.118, "BIST Share Capacity Mode Test" shows the Messages as they flow across the bus and within the 
devices. This test places the UUT in a compliance test mode where the maximum Source capability is always offered 
on every Port, regardless of the availability of shared power i.e., all shared power management is disabled.
1)
Connection is established and stable.
2)
Tester sends a BIST Message with a BIST Shared Test Mode Entry BIST Data Object.
3)
UUT answers with a GoodCRC Message.
4)
UUT enters BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode.
5)
Operator does the measurements.
6)
Tester sends a BIST Message with a BIST Shared Test Mode Exit BIST Data Object.
7)
UUT answers with a GoodCRC Message.
8)
UUT exits BIST Shared Capacity Test Mode.
