Figure 5.9 BMC Receiver Block Diagram
The USB PD baseband signal Shall be driven on the CC wire with a tristate driver that Shall cause a vSwing swing 
on CC. The tristate driver is slew rate limited (see min rise/fall time in Section 5.8.5, "BMC Transmitter 
Specifications") to limit coupling to D+/D- and to other signal lines in the USB Type-C fully featured cables (see [USB 
Type-C 2.4]). This slew rate limiting can be performed either with driver design or an RC filter on the driver output.
When sending the Preamble, the transmitter Shall start by transmitting a low level. The receiver Shall tolerate the 
loss of the first edge. The transmitter May vary the start of the Preamble by tStartDrive min (see Figure 5.10, "BMC 
Encoded Start of Preamble").
Figure 5.10 BMC Encoded Start of Preamble
The transmitter Shall terminate the final bit of the Frame by an edge (the “trailing edge”) to help ensure that the 
receiver clocks the final bit. If the trailing edge results in the transmitter driving CC low (i.e., the final half-UI of the 
Frame is high, see Figure 5.11, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by Zero with High-to-Low 
Last Transition" and Figure 5.12, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by One with High-to-
Low Last Transition"), then the transmitter:

Shall continue to drive CC low for tHoldLowBMC.

Should release CC to high impedance as soon as possible after min tHoldLowBMC and Shall release CC 
by max tEndDriveBMC.
Figure 5.11, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by Zero with High-to-Low Last Transition" 
illustrates the end of a BMC encoded Frame with an encoded zero for which the final bit of the Frame is terminated 
by a high to low transition. Figure 5.12, "Transmitting or Receiving BMC Encoded Frame Terminated by One with 
High-to-Low Last Transition" illustrates the end of a BMC Encoded Frame with an encoded one for which the final 
bit of the Frame is terminated by a high to low transition. Both figures also illustrate the tInterFrameGap timing 
requirement before the start of the next Frame when the Port has either been transmitting or receiving the 
previous Frame (see Section 5.8.5.4, "Inter-Frame Gap").
