Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
In a USB based system, policy is managed by the host and communication of system level policy information is via 
standard USB data line communication. This is a separate mechanism to the USB Power Delivery VBUS protocol 
which is used to manage Local Policy. When USB Communication is used, status information and control requests 
are passed directly between the System Policy Manager (SPM) on the host and the Provider or Consumer. See Figure 
9.3, "Use of SPM in the PD System".
Figure 9.3 Use of SPM in the PD System
Status information comes from a Provider or Consumer to the SPM so it can better manage the resources on the host 
and provide feedback to the end user.
Real systems will be a mixture of devices which in terms of power management support might have implemented 
PD, [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] or they might even just be non-compliant 
“power sucking devices”. The level of communication of system status to the SPM will therefore not necessarily be 
comprehensive. The aim of the status mechanisms described here is to provide a mechanism whereby each 
connected entity in the system provides as much information as possible on the status of itself.
Information described in this section that is communicated to the SPM is as follows:

Versions of USB Type-C®, PD and BC supported.

Capabilities as a Provider/Consumer.

Current operational state of each Port e.g. Standard, USB Type-C Current, BC, PD and Negotiated power 
level.

Status of AC or Battery Power for each PDUSB Device in the system.
The SPM can Negotiate with Providers or Consumers in the system in order to request a different Local Policy, or to 
request the amount of power to be delivered by the Provider to the Consumer. Any change in Local Policy could
