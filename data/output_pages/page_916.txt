  Dual-Role (Source Port) Give Sink Capabilities Extended State 
Diagram
Figure 8.187, "Dual-Role (Source) Give Sink Capabilities Extended diagram" shows the state diagram for a Dual-Role 
device, presently operating as a Sink, on receiving a Get_Sink_Cap_Extended Message. See also Section 6.5.13, 
"Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message".

  PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap_Ext State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap_Ext state, from the PE_SRC_Ready state, when 
a Get_Sink_Cap_Extended Message is received. 
On entry to the PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall request the present extended Sink 
Capabilities from the Device Policy Manager and then send a Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message based on these 
capabilities.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SRC_Ready state (see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State 
Diagram")when:

The Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message has been successfully sent.

Actions on entry:
Get present extended sink capabilities from Device Policy Manager
Send Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message (based on Device Policy Manager response):
• If Get_Sink_Cap Message received send Sink_Capabilities Message.
• In EPR_Get_Sink Cap Message received send EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message
