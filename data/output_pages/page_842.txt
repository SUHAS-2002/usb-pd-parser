Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Protocol Errors occurring in the following situations Shall Not lead to a Soft Reset, but Shall result in a transition 
to the PE_SRC_Ready state where the Message received will be handled as if it had been received in the 
PE_SRC_Ready state:

When in an Explicit Contract and Protocol Errors occurred on SOP during any AMS where the first 
Message in the AMS has not yet been sent i.e., an unexpected Message is received instead of the expected 
GoodCRC Message response.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Send_Soft_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall request the SOP Protocol Layer to perform a 
Soft Reset, then Shall send a Soft_Reset Message to the Sink on SOP, and initialize and run the 
SenderResponseTimer. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state when:

An Accept Message has been received on SOP.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

A SenderResponseTimer timeout occurs.

Or the Protocol Layer indicates that a transmission error has occurred.
8.3.3.4.1.2
  PE_SRC_Soft_Reset State
The PE_SRC_Soft_Reset state Shall be entered from any state when a Soft_Reset Message is received on SOP from 
the Protocol Layer.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Soft_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall reset the SOP Protocol Layer and Shall then request 
the Protocol Layer to send an Accept Message on SOP.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state (see Section 8.3.3.2.3, 
"PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities State") when:

The Accept Message has been sent on SOP.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

The Protocol Layer indicates that a transmission error has occurred.
