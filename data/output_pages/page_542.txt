  Source Initiated Power Role Swap (Reject)
This is an example of a rejected Power Role Swap operation initiated by a Port which initially, at the start of this 
Message sequence, is acting as a Source and therefore has Rp pulled up on its CC wire.
There are several phases to the Power Role Swap:

A PR_Swap Message is sent.

An Reject Message in response to the PR_Swap Message.
Figure 8.34, "Rejected Power Role Swap Sequence Initiated by the Source" shows the Messages as they flow across 
the bus and within the devices.
