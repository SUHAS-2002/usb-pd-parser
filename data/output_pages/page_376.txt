7.3.1.3.4
  Decreasing the Programmable Power Supply (PPS) Current
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when decreasing the 
current limit in the same APDO, not exceeding the minimum for that APDO and without changing the requested 
voltage is shown in Figure 7.34, "Transition Diagram for decreasing the Current in PPS mode". The sequence that 
Shall be followed is described in Table 7.13, "Sequence Description for decreasing the Current in PPS mode". The 
timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink 
Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.34, "Transition Diagram for decreasing the Current in PPS mode", the Sink has previously sent 
a Request Message to the Source.
