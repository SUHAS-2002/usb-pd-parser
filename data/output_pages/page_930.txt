8.3.3.22.2.1
  PE_RESP_VDM_Get_SVIDs State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_RESP_VDM_Get_SVIDs state from either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready 
or PE_CBL_Ready state when:

A Structured VDM Discover SVIDs Command request is received.
On entry to the PE_RESP_VDM_Get_SVIDs state the Responder Shall request SVIDs information from the Device 
Policy Manager.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_RESP_VDM_Send_SVIDs state when:

SVIDs information is received from the Device Policy Manager.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_RESP_VDM_Get_SVIDs_NAK state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that the response to the Discover SVIDs Command request is NAK 
or BUSY.
8.3.3.22.2.2
  PE_UFP_VDM_Send_SVIDs State
On entry to the PE_RESP_VDM_Send_SVIDs state the Responder Shall send the Structured VDM Discover SVIDs ACK 
Command response.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or PE_CBL_Ready state when:

The Structured VDM Discover SVIDs ACK Command response has been sent.
8.3.3.22.2.3
  PE_UFP_VDM_Get_SVIDs_NAK State
On entry to the PE_RESP_VDM_Get_SVIDs_NAK state the Policy Engine Shall send a Structured VDM Discover SVIDs 
NAK or BUSY Command response as indicated by the Device Policy Manager.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or PE_CBL_Ready state when:

The Structured VDM Discover SVIDs NAK or BUSY Command response has been sent.
