17
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
18
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine asks the DPM to turn on VCONN.
19
The DPM informs the Policy Engine that its power 
supply is supplying VCONN. The Policy Engine directs 
the Protocol Layer to generate a PS_RDY Message to tell 
the Source it can turn off VCONN.
20
Protocol Layer creates the PS_RDY Message and passes 
to PHY Layer.
21
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the PS_RDY 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
22
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the PS_RDY 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
23
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
24
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message. The Policy Engine stops the VCONNOnTimer, 
and tells the power supply to stop sourcing VCONN.
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares the 
CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
26
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
27
VCONN is off.
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent.
The Port Partners have swapped VCONN Source role.
