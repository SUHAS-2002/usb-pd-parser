6.4.1.2
  Source Power Data Objects
This section lists the types of PDOs a Source can use in an SPR Capabilities or EPR Capabilities Message.
6.4.1.2.1
  Fixed Supply Power Data Object 
Table 6.9, "Fixed Supply PDO – Source" describes the Fixed Supply (00b) PDO. See Section 7.1.3, "Types of Sources"for 
the electrical requirements of the power supply.
Since all USB Providers support vSafe5V, the required vSafe5V Fixed Supply Power Data Object is also used to 
convey additional information that is returned in bits 29…23. All other Fixed Supply Power Data Objects Shall set 
bits 29…23 to zero.
For a Source offering no Capabilities, the Voltage field (B19…10) Shall be set to 5V and theMaximum Current field 
Shall be set to 0mA. This is used in cases such as a Dual-Role Power device which offers no Capabilities in its default 
Power Role or when external power is required to offer power.
When a Source wants a Sink, consuming power from VBUS, to go to its lowest power state, the Voltage field 
(B19…10) Shall be set to 5V and the Maximum Current field Shall be set to 0mA. This is used in cases where the 
Source wants the Sink to draw pSnkSusp.
6.4.1.2.1.1
  Dual-Role Power
The Dual-Role Power bit Shall be set when the Port is Dual-Role Power capable i.e., supports the PR_Swap Message. 
This is a Static capability which Shall remain fixed for a given device regardless of the device's present Power Role. 
If the Dual-Role Power bit is set to one in the Source_Capabilities Message the Dual-Role Power bit in the 
Sink_Capabilities Message Shall also be set to one. If the Dual-Role Power bit is set to zero in the 
Source_Capabilities Message the Dual-Role Power bit in the Sink_Capabilities Message Shall also be set to zero.
6.4.1.2.1.2
  USB Suspend Supported
Prior to an Explicit Contract or when the USB Communications Capable bit is set to zero, the USB Suspend 
Supported flag is undefined and Sinks Shall follow the rules for suspend as defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], 
[USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2]. After an Explicit Contract has been Negotiated:

If the USB Suspend Supported flag is set, then the Sink Shall follow the [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2] or [USB4] 
rules for suspend and resume. A PDUSB Peripheral May draw up to pSnkSusp during suspend; a PDUSB 
Hub May draw up to pHubSusp during suspend (see Section 7.2.3, "Sink Standby").
