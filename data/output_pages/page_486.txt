16
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
17
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. 
18
The Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter. It informs the Policy Engine that 
the EPR_Request Message was successfully sent. The 
Protocol Layer stops the CRCReceiveTimer.
The Policy Engine starts SenderResponseTimer.
19
Policy Engine evaluates the EPR_Request Message 
sent by the Sink and decides it can’t meet the request. It 
tells the Protocol Layer to form a Reject Message. 
20
The Protocol Layer forms the Reject Message that is 
passed to the PHY Layer.
21
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Reject Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
22
PHY Layer forwards the Reject Message to the Protocol 
Layer.
23
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that a Reject 
Message has been received. The Policy Engine stops 
SenderResponseTimer.
24
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
25
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC 
it calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
26
PHY Layer forwards the GoodCRC Message to the 
Protocol Layer. The Protocol Layer verifies and 
increments the MessageIDCounter and stops the 
CRCReceiveTimer.
27
The Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that a 
Reject Message was successfully sent.
