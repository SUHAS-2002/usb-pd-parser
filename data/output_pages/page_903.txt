8.3.3.19.5.1
  PE_SRC_Ready State
The Fast Role Swap process Shall start only from the PE_SRC_Ready state where power is stable.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Evaluate_Swap state when:

An FR_Swap Message is received.
8.3.3.19.5.2
  PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Evaluate_Swap State
On entry to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Evaluate_Swap state the Policy Engine Shall ask the Device Policy Manager 
whether Fast Role Swap has been signaled on the CC wire.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Accept_Swap state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that a Fast Role Swap has been signaled.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that a Fast Role Swap is not being signaled.
8.3.3.19.5.3
  PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Accept_Swap State
On entry to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Accept_Swap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send an 
Accept Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Transition_to_off state when:

The Accept Message has been sent.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

The Accept Message is not sent after retries (a GoodCRC Message has not been received).
Note:
A Soft Reset Shall Not be initiated in this case.
8.3.3.19.5.4
  PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Transition_to_off State
On entry to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Transition_to_off state the Policy Engine Shall wait until VBUS has discharged to 
vSafe5V.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Assert_Rd state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that VBUS has discharged to vSafe5V.
8.3.3.19.5.5
  PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Assert_Rd State
On entry to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Assert_Rd state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager to 
change the resistor asserted on the CC wire from Rp to Rd.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Wait_Source_on state when:

The Device Policy Manager indicates that Rd is asserted.
8.3.3.19.5.6
  PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Wait_Source_on State
On entry to the PE_FRS_SRC_SNK_Wait_Source_on state the Policy Engine Shall request the Protocol Layer to send 
a PS_RDY Message and Shall start the PSSourceOnTimer.
On exit from the Source off state the Policy Engine Shall stop the PSSourceOnTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Startup when:

A PS_RDY Message is received indicating that the New Source is now applying Rp.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the ErrorRecovery state when:
