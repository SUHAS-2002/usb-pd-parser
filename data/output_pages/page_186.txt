  Discover SVIDs
The Discover SVIDs Command is used by an Initiator to determine the SVIDs for which a Responder has Modes. The 
Discover SVIDs Command is used in conjunction with the Discover Modes Command in the Discovery Process to 
determine which Modes a device supports. The list of SVIDs is always terminated with one or two 0x0000 SVIDs.
The SVID in the Discover SVIDs Command Shall be set to the PD SID (see "Table 6.31, "SVID Values") by both the 
Initiator and the Responder for this Command. 
The Number of Data Objects field in the Message Header in the Discover SVIDs Command request Shall be set to 
1 since the Discover SVIDs Command request Shall Not contain any VDOs. 
The Discover SVIDs Command ACK sent back by the Responder Shall contain one or more SVIDs. The SVIDs are 
returned 2 per VDO (see Table 6.45, "Discover SVIDs Responder VDO"). If there are an odd number of supported 
SVIDs, the Discover SVIDs Command is returned ending with a SVID value of 0x0000 in the last part of the last VDO. 
If there are an even number of supported SVIDs, the Discover SVIDs Command is returned ending with an 
additional VDO containing two SVIDs with values of 0x0000. A Responder Shall only return SVIDs for which a 
Discover Modes Command request for that SVID will return at least one Alternate Mode. 
A Responder that does not support any SVIDs Shall return a NAK.
The Number of Data Objects field in the Message Header in the Discover SVIDs Command NAK and BUSY 
responses Shall be set to 1 since they Shall Not contain any VDOs.
If the Responder supports 12 or more SVIDs then the Discover SVIDs Command Shall be executed multiple times 
until a Discover SVIDs VDO is returned ending either with a SVID value of 0x0000 in the last part of the last VDO 
or with a VDO containing two SVIDs with values of 0x0000. Each Discover SVID ACK Message, other than the one 
containing the terminating 0x0000 SVID, Shall convey 12 SVIDs. The Responder Shall restart the list of SVIDs each 
time a Discover Identity Command request is received from the Initiator.
Note:
Since a Cable Plug does not retry Messages if the GoodCRC Message from the Initiator becomes corrupted 
the Cable Plug will consider the Discover SVIDs Command ACK unsent and will send the same list of 
SVIDs again.
Figure 6.18, "Example Discover SVIDs response with 3 SVIDs" shows an example response to the Discover SVIDs 
Command request with two VDOs containing three SVIDs. Figure 6.19, "Example Discover SVIDs response with 4 
SVIDs" shows an example response with two VDOs containing four SVIDs followed by an empty VDO to terminate 
the response. Figure 6.20, "Example Discover SVIDs response with 12 SVIDs followed by an empty response" shows an 
example response with six VDOs containing twelve SVIDs followed by an additional request that returns an empty 
VDO indicating there are no more SVIDs to return.

SVID n
16-bit unsigned integer, assigned by the USB-IF or 0x0000 if this is the 
last VDO and the Responder supports an even number of SVIDs.

SVID n+1
16-bit unsigned integer, assigned by the USB-IF or 0x0000 if this is the 
last VDO and the Responder supports an odd or even number of SVIDs.
