On entry to the PE_SNK_Ready state if the current Explicit Contract is for an SPR PPS APDO, then the Policy Engine 
Shall do the following: 

Initialize and run the SinkPPSPeriodicTimer.
On entry to the PE_SNK_Ready state if the Sink supports Fast Role Swap, then the Policy Engine Shall do the 
following:

Send a Get_Sink_Cap Message.
On exit from the PE_SNK_Ready state, if the transition is as a result of a DPM request to start a new Atomic Message 
Sequence (AMS) then the Policy Engine Shall notify the Protocol Layer that the first Message in an AMS will follow. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Evaluate_Capability state when:

In SPR Mode and a Source_Capabilities Message is received or

In EPR Mode and an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Select_Capability state when:

A new power level is requested by the Device Policy Manager or

A SinkRequestTimer timeout occurs or

A SinkPPSPeriodicTimer timeout occurs.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Give_Sink_Cap state when:

Get_Sink_Cap Message is received or

EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Get_Source_Cap state when:

The Device Policy Manager requests an update of the remote Source Capabilities. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_EPR_Keep_Alive state when:

The SinkEPRKeepAliveTimer timeouts out. 
8.3.3.3.8
  PE_SNK_Hard_Reset State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state from any state when:

(PSTransitionTimer times out) and

(HardResetCounter ≤ nHardResetCount)) |

Hard Reset request from Device Policy Manager or

In EPR Mode and

An EPR_Source_Capabilities Message is received with an EPR (A)PDO in object positions 1…7 or

A Source_Capabilities Message is received that has not been requested using a Get_Source_Cap 
Message.
The Policy Engine May transition to the PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state from any state when:

SinkWaitCapTimer times out
Note:
If the SinkWaitCapTimer times out and the HardResetCounter is greater than nHardResetCount the 
Sink Shall assume that the Source is non-responsive.
Note:
The HardResetCounter is reset on a power cycle or Detach.
