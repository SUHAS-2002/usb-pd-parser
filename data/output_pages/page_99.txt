Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
Page 99
The received signal is composed of a waveform compliant to the Tx mask plus the maximum value of vNoiseActive 
plus vIRDropGNDC where the vIRDropGNDC value transitions between the minimum and the maximum values as 
allowed in this spec. 
The vertical dimension of the Rx inner mask for sinking power is derived by reducing the vertical dimension of the 
Tx inner mask by vNoiseActive max and vIRDropGNDC max for account for both cable noise coupling and signal 
DC offset. The received signal is composed of a waveform compliant to the Tx mask plus the maximum value of 
vNoiseActive plus vIRDropGNDC where the vIRDropGNDC value transitions between the minimum and the 
maximum values as allowed in this spec. 
The center line of the Rx inner mask, Y3Rx, is at half of the nominal vSwing for power neutral, and is shifted up by 
half of vIRDropGNDC max for sourcing power and is shifted down by half of vIRDropGNDC max for sinking power.
The receiver sensitivity Shall be set such that the receiver does not treat noise on an undriven signal path as an 
incoming signal. Signal amplitudes below vNoiseIdle max Shall be treated as noise when BMC is Idle.
