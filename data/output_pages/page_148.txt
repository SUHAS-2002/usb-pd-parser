6.4.1.3
  Sink Power Data Objects
This section lists the types of PDOs a Sink can use in an SPR or EPR Capabilities Message.
6.4.1.3.1
  Sink Fixed Supply Power Data Object
Table 6.17, "Fixed Supply PDO – Sink" describes the Sink Fixed Supply (00b) PDO. See Section 7.1.3, "Types of Sources" 
for the electrical requirements of the power supply. The Sink Shall set the Voltage field to its required voltage and 
the Operational Current field to its required operating current. Required operating current is defined as the 
amount of current a given device needs to be functional. This value could be the maximum current the Sink will 
ever require or could be sufficient to operate the Sink in one of its modes of operation.
Since all USB Consumers support vSafe5V, the required vSafe5V Fixed Supply Power Data Object is also used to 
convey additional information that is returned in bits 29 through 20. All other Fixed Supply Power Data Objects 
Shall set bits 29…20 to zero.
For a Sink requiring no power from the Source, the Voltage field Shall be set to 5V and the Operational Current 
field Shall be set to 0mA.
6.4.1.3.1.1
  Dual-Role Power
The Dual-Role Power bit Shall be set when the Port is Dual-Role Power capable i.e., supports the PR_Swap Message. 
This is a Static capability which Shall remain fixed for a given device regardless of the device's present Power Role. 
If the Dual-Role Power bit is set to one in the Source_Capabilities Message the Dual-Role Power bit in the 
Sink_Capabilities Message Shall also be set to one. If the Dual-Role Power bit is set to zero in the 
Source_Capabilities Message the Dual-Role Power bit in the Sink_Capabilities Message Shall also be set to zero.
6.4.1.3.1.2
  Higher Capability
In the case that the Sink needs more than vSafe5V (e.g., 15V) to provide full functionality, then the Higher 
Capability bit Shall be set.
6.4.1.3.1.3
  Unconstrained Power
The Unconstrained Power bit Shall be set when an external source of power is available that is sufficient to 
adequately power the system while charging external devices, or when the device's primary function is to charge 
external devices.
