  Dual-Role (Source Port) Give Sink Capabilities State Diagram
Figure 8.181, "Dual-Role (Source) Give Sink Capabilities diagram" shows the state diagram for a Dual-Role device, 
presently operating as a Source, on receiving a Get_Sink_Cap Message. See also Section , "A Source Port Shall report 
its Capabilities in a series of 32-bit Power Data Objects (see Table 6.7, "Power Data Object") as part of a 
Source_Capabilities Message (see Figure 6.13, "Example Capabilities Message with 2 Power Data Objects"). Power 
Data Objects are used to convey a Source Port's Capabilities to provide power including Dual-Role Power ports 
presently operating as a Sink.".

  PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap state, from the PE_SRC_Ready state, when a 
Get_Sink_Cap Message or EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message is received. 

On entry to the PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap state the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy 
Manager for the current system capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall then request the Protocol Layer to 
send a Sink_Capabilities Message containing these capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall send:

A Sink_Capabilities Message when a Get_Sink_Cap Message is received or

An EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message when a EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SRC_Ready state (see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State Diagram") 
when:

The Sink_Capabilities Message has been successfully sent.
Get_Sink_Cap_Extended Message
received
Sink_Capabilities_Extended
Message sent
PE_SRC_Ready
PE_DR_SRC_Give_Sink_Cap_Ext
Actions on entry:
Get present extended sink capabilities from Device Policy Manager
Send Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message (based on Device Policy Manager response)
