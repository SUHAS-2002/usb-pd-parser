Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to increase its 
output voltage. 
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
If the voltage increase is larger than vAvsSmallStep, 
the Sink Shall reduce its current draw to iSnkStdby 
within tSnkStdby. The reduction to iSnkStdby is not 
required if the voltage increase is less than or equal 
to vAvsSmallStep.
3
After sending the Accept Message, the AVS starts to 
increase its output voltage. The AVS new voltage set-
point Shall be reached by tAvsSrcTransLarge for 
steps larger than vAvsSmallStep or else by 
tAvsSrcTransSmall. The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it has reached the new 
level. The power supply status is passed to the Policy 
Engine.
4
The Policy Engine sends the PS_RDY Message to the 
Sink starting within tAvsSrcTransSmall or 
tAvsSrcTransLarge of the end of the GoodCRC 
Message following the Accept Message.
The Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from 
the Source.
5
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer, evaluates the PS_RDY Message 
from the Source and tells the Device Policy Manager 
that the Source is operating at the new voltage set 
point. The Sink May begin operating at the new 
power level any time after evaluation of the PS_RDY 
Message.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
