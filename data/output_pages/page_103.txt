  Transmitter Load Model
The transmitter load model Shall be equivalent to the circuit outlined in Figure 5.23, "Transmitter Load Model for 
BMC Tx from a Source" for a Source and Figure 5.24, "Transmitter Load Model for BMC Tx from a Sink" for a Sink. It 
is formed by the concatenation of a cable load model and a receiver load model. See [USB Type-C 2.4] for details of 
the Rp and Rd resistors. 
Note:
The parameters zCable_CC, tCableDelay_CC and cCablePlug_CC are defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].

The transmitter system components rOutput and cShunt are illustrated for Informative purposes, and do not form 
part of the transmitter load model. See Section 5.8.5, "BMC Transmitter Specifications" for a description of the 
transmitter system design.
The value of the modeled cable inductance, La, (in nH) Shall be calculated from the following formula:
La= tCableDelay_CCmax* zCable_CCmin
tCableDelay_CC is the modeled signal propagation delay through the cable, and zCable_CC is the modeled cable 
impedance.
The modeled cable inductance is 640nH for a cable with zCable_CCmin = 32Ω and tCableDelay_CCmax = 20ns.
The value of the modeled cable capacitance, Ca, (in pF) Shall be calculated from the following formula:
Ca=tCableDelay_CCmax/zCable_CCmin 
The modeled cable capacitance is Ca = 625pF for a cable with zCable_CCmin = 32Ω and tCableDelay_CCmax = 20ns. 
Therefore, Ca/2 = 312.5pF.
cCablePlug_CC models the capacitance of the plug at each end of the cable. cReceiver models the capacitance of the 
receiver. The maximum values Shall be used in each case.
