5.6
  Packet Format 
The Packet format Shall consist of a Preamble, an SOP*, (see Section 5.6.1.2, "Start of Packet Sequences"), Packet data 
including the Message Header, a CRC and an EOP (see Section 5.6.1.5, "End of Packet (EOP)"). The Packet format is 
shown in Figure 5.3, "USB Power Delivery Packet Format" and indicates which parts of the Packet Shall be 4b/5b 
encoded. Once 4b/5b encoded, the entire Packet Shall be transmitted using BMC over CC. 
Note:
All the bits in the Packet, including the Preamble, are BMC encoded. 
See Section 6.2.1, "Message Construction" for more details of the Packet construction for Control Messages, Data 
Messages and Extended Messages.

5.6.1
  Packet Framing
The transmission starts with a Preamble that is used to allow the receiver to lock onto the carrier. It is followed by 
a SOP* (Start of Packet). The Packet is terminated with an EOP (End of Packet) K-code.
5.6.1.1
  Preamble
The Preamble is used to achieve lock in the receiver by presenting an alternating series of "0s" and "1s", so the 
average frequency is the carrier frequency. Unlike the rest of the Packet, the Preamble Shall Not be 4b/5b encoded.
The Preamble Shall consist of a 64-bit sequence of alternating 0s and 1s. The Preamble Shall start with a "0" and 
Shall end with a "1".

  Start of Packet Sequences
5.6.1.2.1
  Start of Packet Sequence (SOP)
SOP is an ordered set. The SOP ordered set is defined as: three Sync-1 K-codes followed by one Sync-2 K-code (see 
Table 5.5, "SOP Ordered Set").
A Power Delivery Capable Source or Sink Shall be able to detect and communicate with Packets using SOP. If a Valid 
SOP is not detected (see Table 5.3, "Validation of Ordered Sets") then the whole transmission Shall be Discarded.
Sending and receiving of SOP Packets Shall be limited to PD Capable Ports on PDUSB Hosts and PDUSB Devices. 
Cable Plugs and VPDs Shall neither send nor receive SOP Packets.
