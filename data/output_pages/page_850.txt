  Source Port Not Supported Message State Diagram
Figure 8.138, "Source Port Not Supported Message State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a Not_Supported 
Message sent or received by a Source Port.
Figure 8.138 Source Port Not Supported Message State Diagram
8.3.3.6.1.1
  PE_SRC_Send_Not_Supported State
The PE_SRC_Send_Not_Supported state Shall be entered from the PE_SRC_Ready state either as the result of a 
Protocol Error received during an interruptible AMS or as a result of an Unsupported Message being received in the 
PE_SRC_Ready state directly except for the first Chunk in a multi-Chunk Message (see also Section 6.12.2.1, "Protocol 
Layer Chunking" and Section 8.3.3.4.1, "SOP Source Port Soft Reset and Protocol Error State Diagram").
On entry to the PE_SRC_Send_Not_Supported state (from the PE_SRC_Ready state) the Policy Engine Shall request 
the Protocol Layer to send a Not_Supported Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the previous state (PE_SRC_Ready see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State 
Diagram") when:

The Not_Supported Message has been successfully sent.
8.3.3.6.1.2
  PE_SRC_Not_Supported_Received State
The PE_SRC_Not_Supported_Received state Shall be entered from the PE_SRC_Ready state when a Not_Supported 
Message is received.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Not_Supported_Received state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the previous state (PE_SRC_Ready see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State 
Diagram") when:

The Device Policy Manager has been informed.
8.3.3.6.1.3
  PE_SRC_Chunk_Received State
The PE_SRC_Chunk_Received state Shall be entered from the PE_SRC_Ready state as a result of an Unsupported 
Message being received in the PE_SRC_Ready state directly where the Message is a Chunk in a multi-Chunk Message 
(see also Section 6.12.2.1, "Protocol Layer Chunking" and Section 8.3.3.4.1, "SOP Source Port Soft Reset and Protocol 
Error State Diagram").

1)
Transition as a result of an unsupported Message being received in the PE_SRC_Ready state directly 
(see also Section 8.3.3.4.1 “SOP Source Port Soft Reset and Protocol Error State Diagram”).
2)
Transition can only occur where a manufacturer has opted not to implement a Chunking state machine (see Section 6.12.2.1 “Protocol Layer Chunking”)
and is communicating with a system which is attempting to send it Chunks.
