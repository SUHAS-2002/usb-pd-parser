Figure D.2 BMC AC and DC noise from VBUS at Power Sink
Figure D.3 Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise
The BMC signals shown in Figure D.3, "Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise" 
are sampled every 50ns and the scaled derivative waveforms, Vcc(t) - Vcc (t - 50ns), without and with [USB 2.0] 
noise are shown in Figure D.4, "Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) 
with USB 2.0 Noise" (a) and (b), respectively. In Figure D.4, "Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate 
(a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 Noise" (a), if there is no [USB 2.0] noise, the derivative waveform just 
changes slightly before and after the VBUS current transition. That means, the slope of the BMC waveform is not 
sensitive to the DC offset and is very useful to be used to design a robust receiver against a large DC offset. However, 
the derivative waveforms with [USB 2.0] noise have large perturbation as shown in Figure D.4, "Scaled BMC Signal 
Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 Noise" (b).
