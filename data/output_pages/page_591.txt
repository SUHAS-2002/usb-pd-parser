  Data Role Swap, Initiated by DFP Operating as Sink
8.3.2.9.4.1
  Data Role Swap, Initiated by DFP Operating as Sink (Accept)
Figure 8.49, "Data Role Swap, DFP operating as Sink initiates" shows an example sequence between a Port, which is 
initially a UFP (Device) and a Source (Rp asserted), and a Port which is initially a DFP (Host) and a Sink (Rd asserted). 
A Data Role Swap is initiated by the DFP. During the process the Port Partners maintain their operation as either a 
Source or a Sink (power and Rp/Rd remain constant) but exchange Data Roles between DFP (Host) and UFP (Device).
