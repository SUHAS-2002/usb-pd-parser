PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer.

The Policy Engine requests that Data Role is changed 
from UFP (Device) to DFP (Host).
The Power Delivery Data Role is now a DFP (Host), and 
Port Data Role set to DFP and continues supplying 
power as a Source (Rp asserted).
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
Accept Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine requests that the Data Role is changed to UFP 
(Device), with Port Data Role set to UFP and still 
operating as a Sink (Rp asserted).
The Data Role Swap is complete; the Data Roles have been reversed while maintaining the direction of power flow.
