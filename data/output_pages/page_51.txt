Upstream Facing Port
Indicates the Port’s position in the USB topology typically a Port on a Device as defined in [USB 
Type-C 2.4]. At connection, the Port defaults to operation as a USB Device (when USB 
Communication is supported) and Sink.
USB Attached State
Synonymous with the [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2] definition of the Attached state
USB Communication
Transfer of USB data Packets as defined in [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2].
USB Default Operation
Operation of a Port at Attach or after a Hard Reset where the DFP Source applies vSafe5V on VBUS 
and the UFP Sink is operating at vSafe5V as defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or 
[USBBC 1.2].
USB Device
Either a Hub or a Peripheral device as defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2] and [USB4].
USB Host
The computer system where the USB Host controller is installed as defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 
3.2] and [USB4].
USB Hub
See Hub.
USB Powered State
Synonymous with the [USB 2.0] and [USB 3.2] definition of the powered state.
USB Safe State
State of the USB Type-C connector when there are pins to be re-purposed (see [USB Type-C 2.4]) 
so they are not damaged by and do not cause damage to their Port Partner.
USB Type-A
Term used to refer to any A plug or receptacle including USB Micro-A plugs and USB Standard-
A plugs and receptacles. USB Micro-AB receptacles are assumed to be a combination of USB 
Type-A and USB Type-B.
USB Type-B
Terms used to refer to any B-plug or receptacle including USB Micro-B plugs and USB Standard-
B plugs and receptacles, including the PD and non-PD versions. USB Micro-AB receptacles are 
assumed to be a combination of USB Type-A and USB Type-B.
USB Type-C
Term used to refer to the USB Type-C connector plug, or receptacle as defined in [USB Type-C 
2.4].
USB Type-C Multi-Port 
Charger
A product that exposes multiple USB Type-C Source Ports for the purpose of charging multiple 
connected USB Devices as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4].
USB-C® Port Control
Module in a PD Capable device which controls Attach/Detach and either detects or sets the Rp 
value.
USB-IF PD SID
Standard ID allocated to this specification by the USB Implementer’s Forum.
USB4® Mode
Device is operating in a Mode as defined in [USB4].
UUT
See Unit Under Test.
Variable Supply
A poorly regulated power supply that is not a Battery. This is exposed by the Variable Supply PDO 
(see Section 6.4.2, "Request Message").
VBUS
The VBUS wire delivers power from a Source to a Sink.
VCONN
Once the connection between USB Host and device is established, the CC pin (CC1 or CC2) in the 
receptacle that is not connected via the CC wire through the standard cable is re-purposed to 
source VCONN to power circuits in a Cable Plug, VCONN Powered Accessory or VCONN Powered USB 
Device (see [USB Type-C 2.4]).
VCONN Powered Accessory
An accessory that is powered from VCONN to operate in an Alternate Mode (see [USB Type-C 
2.4]).
VCONN Powered USB Charge 
Through Device
A CT-VPD is a VPD with an additional port for connecting a Source (e.g., a Charger) as defined in 
[USB Type-C 2.4]. 
When no Charger is connected, a CT-VPD behaves as a VPD. 
When a Charger is connected, no PD communication to the CT-VPD itself is possible as CC is 
connected to the Charger port. Hence all PD communication then is with the Charger and the 
cable with which it is connected.
