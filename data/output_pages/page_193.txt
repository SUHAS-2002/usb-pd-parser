Figure 6.26 Command request/response sequence
In order for the Initiator to know that the Command request was actually consumed, it needs an acknowledgment 
from the Responder. There are three responses that indicate the Responder received and processed the Command 
request:

ACK

NAK

BUSY
The Responder Shall complete:

Enter Mode requests within tVDMEnterMode.

Exit Mode requests within tVDMExitMode.

Other requests within tVDMReceiverResponse.
An Initiator not receiving a response within the following times Shall timeout and return to either the 
PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready state (as appropriate):

Enter Mode requests within tVDMWaitModeEntry.

Exit Mode requests within tVDMWaitModeExit.

Other requests within tVDMSenderResponse.
The Responder Shall respond with:

ACK if it recognizes the SVID and can process it at this time. 

NAK:

if it recognizes the SVID but cannot process the Command request
