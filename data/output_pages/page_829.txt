
And the NoResponseTimer times out 

And the HardResetCounter > nHardResetCount. 
Note:
In the PE_SRC_Disabled state the Attached device is assumed to be unresponsive. The Policy Engine 
operates as if the device is Detached until such time as a Detach/Re-attach is detected.
8.3.3.2.3
  PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities State
Note:
This state can be entered from the PE_SRC_Soft_Reset state.
On entry to the PE_SRC_Send_Capabilities state the Policy Engine Shall request the present Port capabilities from 
the Device Policy Manager. The Policy Engine Shall then request the Protocol Layer to send a capabilities Message 
containing these capabilities. The Policy Engine Shall request:

A Source_Capabilities Message if the Source is in SPR Mode or

An EPR_Source_Capabilities Message if the Source is in EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall then increment the CapsCounter (if implemented). 
If a GoodCRC Message is received, then the Policy Engine Shall:

Stop the NoResponseTimer.

Reset the HardResetCounter and CapsCounter to zero.
Note:
The HardResetCounter Shall only be set to zero in this state and at power up; its value Shall be 
maintained during a Hard Reset.

Initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
Once a Source_Capabilities Message has been received and acknowledged by a GoodCRC Message, the Sink is 
required to then send a Request Message within tSenderResponse.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Negotiate_Capability state when:

A Request Message is received from the Sink and the Source is operating in SPR Mode or

An EPR_Request Message is received from the Sink and the Source is operating in EPR Mode.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Discovery state when:

The Protocol Layer indicates that the Message has not been sent and we are presently not Connected. 
This is part of the Capabilities sending process whereby successful Message sending indicates 
connection to a PD Sink Port.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset state when:

The SenderResponseTimer times out. In this case a transition back to USB Default Operation is 
required.
When:

The Port Partners have not been PD Connected (the Source Port remains Attached to a Port it has not 
had a PD Connection with during this Attachment)

And the NoResponseTimer times out 

And the HardResetCounter > nHardResetCount. 
The Policy Engine Shall do one of the following:

Transition to the PE_SRC_Discovery state.

Transition to the PE_SRC_Disabled state.
