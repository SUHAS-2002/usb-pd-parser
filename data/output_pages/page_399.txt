Sink Port
1
Policy Engine sends Hard Reset Signaling to the 
Source.
2
Policy Engine tells the Device Policy Manager to 
instruct the power supply to prepare for a Hard 
Reset. 
3
The Sink prepares for the Hard Reset within 
tSnkHardResetPrepare (t1) and passes an 
indication to the Device Policy Manager. The Sink 
Shall Not draw more than iSafe0mA when VBUS is 
driven to vSafe0V.
4
Policy Engine is informed of the Hard Reset. 
5
Policy Engine waits tPSHardReset after receiving 
Hard Reset Signaling and then tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to perform a 
Hard Reset. The transition to vSafe0V Shall occur 
within tSafe0V (t2).
6
After tSrcRecover the Source applies power to VBUS 
in an attempt to re-establish communication with the 
Sink and resume USB Default Operation. The 
transition to vSafe5V Shall occur within tSrcTurnOn 
(t3).
The Sink Shall Not violate the transient load 
behavior defined in Section 7.2.6, "Transient Load 
Behavior" while transitioning to and operating at the 
new power level.
