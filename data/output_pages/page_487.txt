  EPR Explicit Contract Negotiation (Wait)
Figure 8.17, "Wait response to Fixed EPR Power Negotiation" illustrates an example of a Message flow where the 
request is responded to with wait while negotiating an Explicit Contract in EPR Mode. The Negotiation goes through 
several distinct phases:

The Source sends out its power Capabilities in an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message.

The Sink evaluates these Capabilities and, in the request phase, selects one power level by sending an 
EPR_Request Message.

The Source evaluates the request and accepts the request with a Wait Message.
