  UFP/VCONN Source SOP'/SOP'' Soft Reset of a Cable Plug or VPD 
State Diagram
Figure 8.207, "UFP/VCONN Source Soft Reset of a Cable Plug or VPD State Diagram" below shows the state diagram 
for the UFP Policy Engine in a VCONN Source when performing a Soft Reset of a Cable Plug or VPD on SOP’/SOP’’. The 
following sections describe operation in each of the states.

8.3.3.25.2.4.1
  PE_UFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset State
The PE_UFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset state Shall be entered from any state when a Protocol Error is detected on 
SOP’/SOP’’ by the Protocol Layer (see Section 6.8.1, "Soft Reset and Protocol Error") or when a Message has not been 
sent after retries on SOP’/SOP’’ while communicating with a Cable Plug/VPD and when there was previous 
communication with the Cable Plug that did not result in a Transmission Error or whenever the Device Policy 
Manager directs a Soft Reset on SOP’/SOP’’.
On entry to the PE_UFP_VCS_CBL_Send_Soft_Reset state the Policy Engine Shall request the SOP’/SOP’’ Protocol 
Layer to perform a Soft Reset, then Shall send a Soft_Reset Message on SOP’/SOP’’ to the Cable Plug, and initialize 
and run the SenderResponseTimer. 
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready state, depending on the UFP VCONN 
Source's Power Role, when:

An Accept Message has been received on SOP’/SOP’’.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to either the PE_SRC_Hard_Reset or PE_SNK_Hard_Reset state, depending on the 
UFP VCONN Source's Power Role, when:

A SenderResponseTimer timeout occurs

Or the Protocol Layer indicates that a transmission error has occurred

Or when a Protocol Error is detected on SOP’/SOP’’ by the Protocol Layer.
