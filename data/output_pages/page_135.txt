the VCONN Source wants to communicate with a Cable Plug using SOP’’ Packets, it Shall issue a Soft_Reset Message 
using a SOP’’ Packet in order to reset the Cable Plug's Protocol Layer.
6.3.14
  Data_Reset Message
The Data_Reset Message May be sent by either the DFP or UFP and Shall reset the USB data connection and exit all 
Alternate Modes with its Port Partner while preserving the power on VBUS. USB4® Mode capable ports Shall support 
the Data_Reset Message and other ports May support the Data_Reset Message.
The Data_Reset Message Shall Not change the existing:

Power Contract

Data Roles (i.e., which Port is the DFP or UFP)
The receiver of the Data_Reset Message Shall respond by sending an Accept Message and then follow the process 
outlined in the following steps. Neither the sender nor receiver Shall initiate a VCONN Swap until the Data Reset 
process is complete, and the Data_Reset_Complete Message has been sent. Following receipt of the Accept 
Message, or GoodCRC following the Accept, depending which Port sends the Data_Reset Message: 
1)
The DFP Shall:

Disconnect the Port's [USB 2.0] D+/D- signals.

If operating in [USB 3.2] remove the Port's Rx Terminations (see [USB 3.2]).

If operating in [USB4] drive the Port's SBTX to a logic low (see [USB4]).
2)
Both the DFP and UFP Shall exit all Alternate Modes if any.
3)
Reset the cable:

If the VCONN Source Port is also the UFP, then it Shall run the UFP VCONN Power Cycle process de-
scribed in Section 7.1.15.1, "UFP VCONN Power Cycle".

If the VCONN Source Port is also the DFP, then it Shall run the DFP VCONN Power Cycle process de-
scribed in Section 7.1.15.2, "DFP VCONN Power Cycle".

The DFP Shall exit the VCONN Power Cycle process as the VCONN Source and be sourcing VCONN.
4)
After tDataReset the DFP Shall:

Reconnect the [USB 2.0] D+/D- signals.

If the Port was operating in [USB 3.2] or [USB4] reapply the Port's Rx Terminations (see [USB 3.2]).
5)
The Data Reset process is complete; the DFP Shall send a Data_Reset_Complete Message and enter the 
USB4® Discovery and Entry Flow (See [USB Type-C 2.4]).
If the Initiator of the Data_Reset Message does not receive a Valid response within tSenderResponse it Shall enter 
the ErrorRecovery State.
6.3.15
  Data_Reset_Complete Message
The Data_Reset_Complete Message Shall be sent by the DFP to the UFP to indicate the completion of the Data Reset 
process (see Section 6.3.14, "Data_Reset Message").
6.3.16
  Not_Supported Message
The Not_Supported Message Shall be sent by a Port or Cable Plug in response to any Message it does not support. 
Returning a Not_Supported Message is assumed in this specification and has not been called out explicitly except 
in Section 6.13, "Message Applicability" which defines cases where the Not_Supported Message is returned.
