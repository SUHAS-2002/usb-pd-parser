capability is intended for direct Port to Charger connections only and Shall Not be offered to downstream Sinks via 
a Hub.
Every EPR AVS APDO Shall contain a Peak Current (Source EPR AVS) field. Supplies that want to offer a set of 
overload Capabilities Shall Advertise this through the Peak Current (Source EPR AVS) field in the corresponding 
EPR AVS APDO (see Table 6.16, "EPR AVS Power Source Peak Current Capability". Supplies that do not support an 
overload capability Shall set these bits to 00b in the corresponding EPR AVS APDO. Supplies that support an 
extended overload capability specified in the PeakCurrent1…3 fields of the Source_Capabilities_Extended 
Message (see Section 6.5.1, "Source_Capabilities_Extended Message") Shall set these bits to 00b. Sinks wishing to 
utilize these Extended Capabilities Shall first send a Get_Source_Cap_Extended Message to determine what 
Capabilities, if any are supported by the Source.
