  Normative Voltages and Currents
The voltages and currents an SPR Source with a PDP Rating of x Watts Shall support are as defined in Table 10.2, 
"SPR Normative Voltages and Minimum Currents".

1)
Requires a 5A cable.
2)
The Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise at least 3A, but May Advertise up to RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA. Requires a 5A cable if over 3A is Advertised.
3)
The Fixed Supply PDOs Maximum Current field Shall Advertise either RoundDown (PDP/voltage) or RoundUp (PDP/voltage) to the 
nearest 10mA.
4)
SPR AVS current for this voltage range is the maximum current as Advertised by the 15V Fixed Supply PDO. This current can be higher 
than 3A (refer to Note 2). Requires a 5A cable if over 3A is Advertised.
5)
The Sink is allowed to request up to the 20V Fixed Supply Max Current when the requested voltage is 15.0V.
