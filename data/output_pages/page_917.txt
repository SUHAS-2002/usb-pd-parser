  Dual-Role (Source Port) Get Source Information State Diagram
Figure 8.188, "Dual-Role (Source) Get Source Information State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a Dual-Role 
device, presently operating as a Source, on receiving a request from the Device Policy Manager to get the Port 
Partner's Source information. See also Section 6.3.23, "Get_Source_Info Message" and Section 6.4.11, "Source_Info 
Message".

  PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Info State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Info state, from the PE_SRC_Ready state, due to a 
request to get the remote Source information from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Info state the Policy Engine Shall send a Get_Source_Info Message and 
initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
On exit from the PE_DR_SRC_Get_Source_Info state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of the 
outcome (information or response timeout).
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SRC_Ready state (see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State Diagram") 
when:

A Source_Info Message is received.

Or SenderResponseTimer times out.
