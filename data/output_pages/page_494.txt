Table 8.46, "Steps for Exiting EPR Mode (Sink Initiated)" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at 
each labeled step in Figure 8.19, "Exiting EPR Mode (Sink Initiated)" above.

The Port Partners are in an Explicit Contract using an SPR (A)PDO (Voltage <= 20V)
1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate an EPR_Mode (Exit) Message to request entry 
to EPR Mode. 
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the EPR_Mode 
(Exit) Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the EPR_Mode (Exit) Message and 
compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify 
the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the EPR_Mode 
(Exit) Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received EPR_Mode 
(Exit) Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it.
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC 
to verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
GoodCRC Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
EPR_Mode (Exit) Message was successfully sent.
10
Policy Engine evaluates the EPR_Mode (Exit) Message 
sent by the Sink. It tells the Protocol Layer to form a 
Source_Capabilities Message.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Source_Capabilities Message 
and passes to PHY Layer.
12
PHY Layer receives the Source_Capabilities Message 
and compares the CRC it calculated with the one sent to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the 
Source_Capabilities Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
13
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the 
Source_Capabilities Message to the Protocol Layer. 
14
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer passes the EPR_Mode (Enter 
Succeeded) information to the Policy Engine.
15
The Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it to its PHY Layer.
16
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the Message.
PHY Layer receives the Message and compares the CRC it 
calculated with the one sent to verify the Message.
