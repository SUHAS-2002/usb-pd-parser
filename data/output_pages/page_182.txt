Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
6.4.4.3.1.7.7
  Cable Termination Type Field
The Cable Termination Type (Active Cable) field (B12…11) Shall contain a value corresponding to whether the 
Active Cable has one or two Cable Plugs requiring power from VCONN.
6.4.4.3.1.7.8
  Maximum VBUS Voltage Field
The Maximum VBUS Voltage (Active Cable) field (B10…9) Shall contain the maximum voltage that Shall be 
Negotiated as part of an Explicit Contract where the maximum voltage that Shall be applied to the cable is vSrcNew 
max + vSrcValid max. When this field is set to 20V, the cable will safely carry a Programmable Power Supply APDO 
of 20V where the absolute maximum voltage that can be applied to the cable is 21.55V. Similarly, when the 
Maximum VBUS Voltage (Active Cable) field is 50V, a Fixed Supply of 48V can be Negotiated as part of an Explicit 
Contract where the absolute maximum voltage that can be applied to the cable is 50.9V. Maximum VBUS Voltage 
(Active Cable) field values of 01b and 10b (formerly 30V and 40V) Shall be treated if they were 00b (20V).
6.4.4.3.1.7.9
  SBU Supported Field
The SBU Supported field (B8) Shall indicate whether the cable supports the SBUs in the cable.
6.4.4.3.1.7.10
  SBU Type Field
The SBU Type field (B7) Shall indicate whether the SBUs are passive or active (e.g., digital).
6.4.4.3.1.7.11
  VBUS Current Handling Capability Field
The VBUS Current Handling Capability (Active Cable) field (B6…5) Shall indicate whether the cable is capable of 
carrying 3A or 5A. The VBUS Current Handling Capability (Active Cable) field Shall only be Valid when the VBUS 
Current Handling Capability (Active Cable) field indicates an end-to-end VBUS wire.
6.4.4.3.1.7.12
   VBUS Through Cable Field
The VBUS Through Cable field (B4) Shall indicate whether the cable contains an end-to-end VBUS wire.
6.4.4.3.1.7.13
  SOP'' Controller Present Field
The SOP’’ Controller Present field (B3) Shall indicate whether one of the Cable Plugs is capable of SOP’’ 
Communication in addition to the Normative SOP’ Communication.
6.4.4.3.1.7.14
  USB Highest Speed Field
The USB Highest Speed (Active Cable) field (B2…0) Shall indicate the highest rate the cable supports. The DFP 
Shall consider all values indicated in this field that are higher than the highest value that the DFP recognizes as 
being Valid and functionally compatible with the highest speed that the DFP supports.
6.4.4.3.1.7.15
  Maximum Operating Temperature Field
Maximum Operating Temperature field (B31…24) Shall report the maximum allowable operating temperature 
inside the plug in °C.
6.4.4.3.1.7.16
  Shutdown Temperature Field
Shutdown Temperature field (B23…16) Shall indicate the temperature inside the plug, in °C, at which the plug 
will shut down its active signaling components. When this temperature is reached, it will be reported in the Active 
Cable Status Message through the Thermal Shutdown bit. 
6.4.4.3.1.7.17
  U3/CLd Power Field
The U3/CLd Power field (B14…12) Shall indicate the power the cable consumes while in [USB 3.2] U3 or [USB4] 
CLd.
6.4.4.3.1.7.18
  U3 to U0 Transition Mode Field
The U3 to U0 transition mode field (B11) Shall indicate which U3 to U0 mode the cable supports. This does not 
include the power in U3S if supported.
