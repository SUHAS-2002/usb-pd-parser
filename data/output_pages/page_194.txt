The ACK, NAK or BUSY response Shall contain the same SVID as the Command request.
6.4.4.4.1
  Discovery Process
The Initiator (usually the DFP) always begins the Discovery Process. The Discovery Process has two phases. In the 
first phase, the Discover SVIDs Command request is sent by the Initiator to get the list of SVIDs the Responder 
supports. In the second phase, the Initiator sends a Discover Modes Command request for each SVID supported by 
both the Initiator and Responder.
6.4.4.4.2
  Enter Vendor Mode / Exit Vendor Mode Processes
The result of the Discovery Process is that both the Initiator and Responder identify the Modes they mutually 
support. The Initiator (DFP), upon finding a suitable Alternate Mode, uses the Enter Mode Command to enable the 
Alternate Mode.
The Responder (UFP or Cable Plug) and Initiator continue using the Active Mode until the Active Mode is exited.
In a managed termination, using the Exit Mode Command, the Active Mode Shall be exited in a controlled manner 
as described in Section 6.4.4.3.5, "Exit Mode Command".
In an unmanaged termination, triggered by:

A Power Delivery Hard Reset (i.e. Hard Reset Signaling sent by either Port Partner) or 

By cable Detach (device unplugged) or

By Error Recovery
the Active Mode Shall still be exited but there Shall Not be a transition through the USB Safe State.
In both the managed and unmanaged terminations, the Initiator and Responder return to USB operation as defined 
in [USB Type-C 2.4] following an exit from an Alternate Mode.
The overall Message flow is illustrated in Figure 6.27, "Enter/Exit Mode Process".
