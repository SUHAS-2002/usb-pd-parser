6.6.3.1
  SourceCapabilityTimer
Prior to the First Explicit Contract a Source Shall use the SourceCapabilityTimer to periodically send out a 
Source_Capabilities Message every tTypeCSendSourceCap while:

The Port is Attached.

The Source is not in an active connection with a PD Sink Port.
Whenever there is a SourceCapabilityTimer timeout the Source Shall send a Source_Capabilities Message. It 
Shall then re-initialize and restart the SourceCapabilityTimer. The SourceCapabilityTimer Shall be stopped 
when the last bit of the EOP corresponding to the GoodCRC Message has been received by the PHY Layer since a PD 
connection has been established. At this point, the Source waits for a Request Message or a response timeout.
Note:
The Source can also stop sending Source_Capabilities Message after nCapsCount Messages have been 
sent without a GoodCRC Message response (see Section 6.7.4, "Capabilities Counter").
See Section 8.3.3.2, "Policy Engine Source Port State Diagram" for more details of when Source_Capabilities 
Messages are transmitted.
6.6.3.2
  SinkWaitCapTimer
The Sink Shall support the SinkWaitCapTimer.
While in a Default Contract or an Implicit Contract when a Sink observes an absence of Source_Capabilities 
Messages, after VBUS is present, for a duration of tTypeCSinkWaitCap the Sink May issue Hard Reset Signaling in 
order to restart the sending of Source_Capabilities Messages by the Source (see Section 6.7.4, "Capabilities 
Counter") or continue to operate at USB Type-C current.
When a Sink, entering EPR Mode, observes an absence of EPR_Source_Capabilities Messages, after the GoodCRC 
Message acknowledging the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 3 (Enter Succeeded), for a duration of 
tTypeCSinkWaitCap the Sink Shall issue Hard Reset Signaling in order to exit EPR Mode (see Section 6.4.10, 
"EPR_Mode Message").
When a Sink, exiting EPR Mode, observes an absence of Source_Capabilities Messages, after the GoodCRC Message 
acknowledging the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit), for a duration of tTypeCSinkWaitCap 
the Sink Shall issue Hard Reset Signaling in order to restart the sending of Source_Capabilities Messages by the 
Source (see Section 6.7.4, "Capabilities Counter").
See Section 8.3.3.3, "Policy Engine Sink Port State Diagram" for more details of when the SinkWaitCapTimer is run.
6.6.3.3
  tFirstSourceCap
After Port Partners are Attached or after a Hard Reset or after a Power Role Swap or after a Fast Role Swap a Source 
Shall send its first Source_Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap of VBUS reaching vSafe5V.
After Soft Reset, a Source Shall send its first Source Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap after last bit of the 
GoodCRC Message EOP corresponding to Accept Message.
This ensures that the Sink receives a Source Capabilities Message before the Sink's SinkWaitCapTimer expires.
A Source entering EPR Mode Shall send its first EPR_Source_Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap of the 
GoodCRC Message acknowledging the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 3 (Enter Succeeded). 
A Source exiting EPR Mode Shall send its first Source_Capabilities Message within tFirstSourceCap of the 
GoodCRC Message acknowledging the EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit).
