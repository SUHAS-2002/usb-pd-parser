1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept Message.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then evaluates the Accept 
Message and starts the PSTransitionTimer.
3
The Policy Engine then sends the PS_RDY Message to 
the Sink starting within tPpsSrcTransSmall of the 
end of the GoodCRC Message following the Accept 
Message.
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message.
4
Policy Engine receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink.
Note: The decision that no power transition is re-
quired could be made either by the Device Pol-
icy Manager or the power supply depending 
on implementation.
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Source. Policy Engine then stops the 
PSTransitionTimer and evaluates the PS_RDY 
Message from the Source. The Sink is already 
operating at the new power level, so no further action 
is required.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
