Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
New Source and then stops the PSSourceOnTimer.
Policy Engine evaluates the PS_RDY Message from 
the New Source and tells the Device Policy Manager to 
instruct the power supply to draw current as the New 
Sink.
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the New Sink.

The power supply as the New Sink transitions from 
Swap Standby and begins to drawing the current 
allowed by the Implicit Contract. The power supply 
informs the Device Policy Manager that it is 
operating as the New Sink. At this point subsequent 
Negotiations between the New Source and the New 
Sink May proceed as normal. The Sink Shall Not 
violate the transient load behavior defined in Section 
7.2.6, "Transient Load Behavior" while transitioning 
to and operating at the new power level. The time 
duration (t4) depends on the magnitude of the load 
change (iLoadStepRate).
