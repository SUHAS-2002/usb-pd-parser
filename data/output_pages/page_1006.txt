10.2.3.2.1
  SPR Programmable Power Supply Voltage Ranges
The SPR PPS Voltage ranges map to the Fixed Supply Voltages. For each fixed voltage there is a defined voltage range 
for the matching SPR PPS APDO. Table 10.11, "SPR Programmable Power Supply Voltage Ranges" shows the 
Minimum and Maximum Voltage for the Programmable Power Supply that corresponds to the Fixed nominal 
voltage.
The voltage output at the Source's connector Shall be +/-5% for both the Maximum Voltage and the Minimum 
Voltage.
