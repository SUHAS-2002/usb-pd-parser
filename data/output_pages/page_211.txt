Other critical errors can occur while in EPR Mode; these errors Shall result in Hard Reset being initiated by the Port 
that detects the error. Some of these errors include:

An EPR_Mode Message with the Action field set to 5 (Exit) to exit EPR Mode is received by a Port in an 
Explicit Contract with an EPR (A)PDO.

The Sink receives an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message with an EPR (A)PDO in any of the first seven 
object positions.

The (A)PDO in the EPR_Request Message does not match the (A)PDO in the latest 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message pointed to by the Object Position field in the RDO.

The Source receives a Request Message.

The Sink receives a Source_Capabilities Message not in response to a Get_Source_Cap Message.
