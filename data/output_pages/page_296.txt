Layer transmission state machine Shall transition to the PRL_Tx_Wait_for_Message_Request state. The Protocol 
Layer reception state machine Shall transition to the PRL_Rx_Wait_for_PHY_Message state.


The Protocol Layer's reset is complete and

The Hard Reset request has originated from the Policy Engine or


The Protocol Layer Shall transition to the PRL_HR_Indicate_Hard_Reset state when:

The Protocol Layer's reset is complete and

The Hard Reset request has been passed up from the PHY Layer or

