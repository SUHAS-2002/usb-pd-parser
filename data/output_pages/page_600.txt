  VCONN Source Swap, initiated by VCONN Source (Accept)
Figure 8.52, "Successful VCONN Source Swap, initiated by VCONN Source" shows an example sequence where the 
VCONN Source and tells its Port Partner to supply VCONN. During the process the Port Partners, keep their Power Role 
as Source or Sink, maintain their operation as either a Source or a Sink (power remains constant) but exchange the 
VCONN Source role.
