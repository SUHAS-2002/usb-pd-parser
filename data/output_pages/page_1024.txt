C.3.2
  Discover Modes Command response
The Responder to the Discover Modes Command request returns a Message Header with the Number of Data 
Objects field set to a value of 1 to 7 (the actual value is the number of Mode objects plus one) followed by a VDM 
Header with the Command Type (B7…6) set to 1 indicating the Command is from a Responder and the Command 
(B4…0) set to 3 indicating the following objects describe the Modes the device supports. If the ID is a VID, the 
structure and content of the VDO is left to the vendor. If the ID is a SID, the structure and content of the VDO is 
defined by the Standard. 
Table C.7, "Discover Modes Command response from Responder Example" shows the contents of the key fields in the 
Message Header and VDM Header for a Responder returning VDOs in response to a Discover Modes Command 
request. In this illustration, the value 2 in the Message Header Number of Data Objects field indicates that the 
device is returning one VDO describing the Mode it supports. It is possible for a Responder to report up to six 
different Modes.
