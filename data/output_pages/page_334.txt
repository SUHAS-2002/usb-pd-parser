   DFP VCONN Power Cycle
The Data Reset process requires the DFP to be the VCONN Source by the end of the process. In the case where the 
DFP is the VCONN Source, the following steps Shall be followed:
1)
If the DFP sent the Data_Reset Message and is sourcing VCONN then it Shall turn off VCONN and ensure it 
is below vRaReconnect (see [USB Type-C 2.4]) within tVCONNZero of the last bit of the GoodCRC 
Message acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the Data_Reset Message.
2)
If the UFP sent the Data_Reset Message then the DFP Shall turn off VCONN and ensure it is below 
vRaReconnect (see [USB Type-C 2.4]) within tVCONNZero following the last bit of the GoodCRC Message 
acknowledging the Accept Message in response to the Data_Reset Message.
3)
When VCONN is below vRaReconnect, the DFP Shall wait tVCONNReapplied before sourcing VCONN.
4)
The DFP Shall ensure VCONN is within vVCONNValid (see [USB Type-C 2.4]) within tVCONNValid.
Figure 7.20, "Data Reset DFP VCONN Power Cycle" below illustrates the DFP VCONN Power Cycle process.
