  Timers
All the following timers are defined in terms of bits on the bus regardless of where they are implemented in terms 
of the logical architecture. This is to ensure a fixed reference for the starting and stopping of timers. It is left to the 
implementer to ensure that this timing is observed in a real system.
6.6.1
  CRCReceiveTimer
The CRCReceiveTimer Shall be used by the sender's Protocol Layer to ensure that a Message has not been lost. 
Failure to receive an acknowledgment of a Message (a GoodCRC Message) whether caused by a bad GoodCRC 
Message on the receiving end or by a garbled Message within tReceive is detected when the CRCReceiveTimer 
expires.
The sender's Protocol Layer response when a CRCReceiveTimer expires Shall be to retry nRetryCount times. 
Note:
Cable Plugs do not retry Messages and large Extended Messages that are not Chunked are not retried (see 
Section 6.7.2, "Retry Counter").
Sending of the Preamble corresponding to the retried Message Shall start within tRetry of the CRCReceiveTimer 
expiring.
The CRCReceiveTimer Shall be started when the last bit of the Message EOP has been transmitted by the PHY 
Layer. The CRCReceiveTimer Shall be stopped when the last bit of the EOP corresponding to the GoodCRC Message 
has been received by the PHY Layer.
The Protocol Layer receiving a Message Shall respond with a GoodCRC Message within tTransmit in order to 
ensure that the sender's CRCReceiveTimer does not expire. The tTransmit time Shall be measured from when the 
last bit of the Message EOP has been received by the PHY Layer until the first bit of the Preamble of the GoodCRC 
Message has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.2
  SenderResponseTimer
The SenderResponseTimer Shall be used by the sender's Policy Engine to ensure that a Message requesting a 
response (e.g., Get_Source_Cap Message) is responded to within a bounded time of tSenderResponse. Failure to 
receive the expected response is detected when the SenderResponseTimer expires.
For Extended Messages received as Chunks, the SenderResponseTimer will also be started and stopped by the 
Chunking Rx State Machine. See Section 8.3.3.1.1, "SenderResponseTimer State Diagram" for more details of the 
SenderResponseTimer operation.
The Policy Engine's response when the SenderResponseTimer expires Shall be dependent on the Message sent 
(see Section 8.3, "Policy Engine").
The SenderResponseTimer Shall be started from the time the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, corresponding 
to the Message requesting a response, has been received by the PHY Layer.
The SenderResponseTimer Shall be stopped when the last bit of the EOP of the GoodCRC Message, corresponding 
to the expected response Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
The receiver of a Message requiring a response Shall respond within tReceiverResponse in order to ensure that 
the sender's SenderResponseTimer does not expire.
The tReceiverResponse time Shall be measured from the time the last bit of the GoodCRC Message EOP, 
corresponding to the expected request Message, has been transmitted by the PHY Layer until the first bit of the 
response Message Preamble has been transmitted by the PHY Layer.
6.6.3
  Capability Timers
Sources and Sinks use Capability Timers to determine Attachment of a PD Capable device. By periodically sending 
or requesting Capabilities, it is possible to determine PD device Attachment when a response is received.
