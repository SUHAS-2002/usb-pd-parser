
The DFP is not presently the VCONN Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to ErrorRecovery when:

A SenderResponseTimer timeout occurs or

A Protocol Error occurs.
8.3.3.5.1.2
  PE_DDR_Data_Reset_Received State
The PE_DDR_Data_Reset_Received State Shall be entered from the PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready State when a 
Data_Reset Message is received.
On entry to the PE_DDR_Data_Reset_Received State the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager and 
then Shall send an Accept Message.
On exit from the PE_DDR_Data_Reset_Received State the Policy Engine Shall initialize and start the 
DataResetFailTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DDR_Perform_Data_Reset State when:

An Accept Message has been sent and

The DFP is presently the VCONN Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DDR_Wait_For_VCONN_Off State when:

An Accept Message has been sent and

The DFP is not presently the VCONN Source.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to ErrorRecovery when:

A Protocol Error occurs.
8.3.3.5.1.3
  PE_DDR_Wait_For_VCONN_Off State
On entry to the PE_DDR_Wait_For_VCONN_Off State the Policy Engine Shall initialize and start the 
VCONNDischargeTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_DDR_Perform_Data_Reset State when:

A PS_RDY Message is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to ErrorRecovery when:

The VCONNDischargeTimer has timed out or

A Protocol Error occurs.
8.3.3.5.1.4
  PE_DDR_Perform_Data_Reset State
On entry to the PE_DDR_Perform_Data_Reset State the Policy Engine Shall request the Device Policy Manager to 
complete the Data Reset process as defined in Section 6.3.14, "Data_Reset Message".
On exit from the PE_DDR_Perform_Data_Reset State the Policy Engine Shall stop the DataResetFailTimer and 
send a Data_Reset_Complete Message.
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to either the PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready State depending on the DFP's 
Power Role when:

The DPM indicates that Data Reset process is complete (see Section 6.3.14, "Data_Reset Message").
The Policy Engine Shall transition to ErrorRecovery when:

The DataResetFailTimer times out

A Protocol Error occurs.
