Table 7.18  Sequence Description for a Sink Requested Power Role Swap
Step
Initial Source Port  New Sink Port
Initial Sink Port  New Source Port
1
Policy Engine sends the Accept Message to the Initial 
Sink.
Policy Engine receives the Accept.
2
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the Sink. The Policy Engine tells the Device Policy 
Manager to instruct the power supply to modify its 
output power. 
Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
Initial Source. Policy Engine then starts the 
PSSourceOffTimer and evaluates the Accept 
Message.
3
Policy Engine tells the Device Policy Manager to 
instruct the power supply to transition to Swap 
Standby within tSnkStdby (t1); t1 Shall complete 
before tSrcTransition min. When in Sink Standby the 
Initial Sink Shall Not draw more than 
iSnkSwapStdby (I1). The Sink Shall Not violate 
transient load behavior defined in Section 7.2.6, 
"Transient Load Behavior" while transitioning to and 
operating at the new power level.
4
tSrcTransition after the GoodCRC Message was 
received, the power supply starts to change its output 
power capability to Swap Standby (see Section 7.1.10, 
"Swap Standby for Sources"). The power supply Shall 
complete the transition to Swap Standby within 
tSrcSwapStdby (t2). The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it is ready to operate as 
the New Sink. The CC termination is changed from Rp 
to Rd (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). The power supply 
status is passed to the Policy Engine.
5
The power supply is ready, and the Policy Engine 
sends the PS_RDY Message to the device that will 
become the New Source, starting within 
tSrcTransOff of the end of the GoodCRC Message 
following the Accept Message.
6
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the device that will become the New Source.
Policy Engine starts the PSSourceOnTimer. Upon 
sending the PS_RDY Message and receiving the 
GoodCRC Message the Initial Source is ready to be the 
New Sink.
The Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to 
the New Sink.
Policy Engine the stops the PSSourceOffTimer and 
tells the Device Policy Manager to instruct the power 
supply to operate as the New Source.
If the PS_RDY Message is not received before 
PSTransitionTimer times out the Sink sends Hard 
Reset Signaling.
7
The CC termination is changed from Rd to Rp (see 
[USB Type-C 2.4]). The power supply as the New 
Source transitions from Swap Standby to sourcing 
default vSafe5V within tNewSrc (t3). The power 
supply informs the Device Policy Manager that it is 
operating as the New Source.
8
Policy Engine receives the PS_RDY Message from the 
Source.
Device Policy Manager informs the Policy Engine the 
power supply is ready, and the Policy Engine sends 
the PS_RDY Message to the New Sink, starting within 
tSrcTransOn of the end of the GoodCRC Message 
following the Accept Message.
