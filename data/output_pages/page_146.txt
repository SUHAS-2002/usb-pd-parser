6.4.1.2.4.2
  SPR Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO
Table 6.14, "SPR Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO – Source" below describes the SPR AVS (1110b) APDO for a Source 
operating in SPR Mode and supplying 9V up to 20V. 
6.4.1.2.4.2.1
  Peak Current
The Peak Current field follows the same definition as for the Peak Current field (see Section 6.4.1.2.1.8, "Peak 
Current" and Table 6.10, "Fixed Power Source Peak Current Capability".
6.4.1.2.4.3
  EPR Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO
Table 6.15, "EPR Adjustable Voltage Supply APDO – Source" below describes the EPR AVS (1101b) APDO for a Source 
operating in EPR Mode and supplying 15V up to 48V. 
6.4.1.2.4.3.1
  PDP
The PDP field Shall contain the AVS Port's PDP.
See Section 10.2.3.3, "Optional Normative Extended Power Range (EPR)" and Figure 10.6, "Valid EPR AVS Operating 
Region" for more information regarding how PDP in the AVS APDO relates to maximum available current.
6.4.1.2.4.3.2
  Peak Current
The USB Power Delivery EPR AVS is only required to deliver the amount of current requested in the Operating 
Current field (IoC) of an AVS RDO. In some usages however, for example computer systems, where there are short 
bursts of activity, it might be desirable to overload the Source for short periods.
For example, when a computer system tries to maintain average power consumption, the higher the peak current, 
the longer the low current period needed to maintain such average power (see Section 7.2.8, "Sink Peak Current 
Operation"). The Peak Current (Source EPR AVS) field allows a Source to Advertise this additional capability. This
