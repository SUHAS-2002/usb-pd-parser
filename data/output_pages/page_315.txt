result in a voltage that is greater than or equal to the previous PPS output voltage. Likewise, all PPS voltage 
decreases Shall result in a voltage that is less than or equal to the previous PPS output voltage.
Since a Sink can draw current up to the Negotiated APDO current level in case of a voltage step, the voltage might 
not increase to the requested level due to the power supply operating in CL mode. Likewise, since a Sink can have 
a Battery connected to VBUS, the voltage might not decrease to the requested level due to the Battery voltage being 
higher than the output voltage set point the Source is transitioning to. Were the Source to rely on checking the 
voltage on VBUS, in either case, to determine when its power supply is ready a PS_RDY Message would never be sent. 
When the PPS voltage steps up or down, a PS_RDY Message Shall be sent within:

tPpsSrcTransLarge after the last bit of the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message for steps 
larger than vPpsSmallStep.

tPpsSrcTransSmall after the last bit of the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message for steps 
less than or equal to vPpsSmallStep provided that either the voltage on VBUS has reached vPpsNew or 
the power supply is in CL mode.
When vPpsNew is lower than the Battery voltage, or the Source's primary power is cut off the Sink Shall 
immediately disconnect its Battery from VBUS. In these situations, the output current could reverse polarity and the 
Sink is not allowed to source current (see Section 7.2.1, "Behavioral Aspects" and Section 7.2.9, "Robust Sink 
Operation").
Figure 7.4, "PPS Positive Voltage Transitions" and Figure 7.5, "PPS Negative Voltage Transitions" below show the 
output voltage behavior of a Programmable Power Supply in response to positive and negative voltage change 
requests. The parameters vPpsMinVoltage and vPpsMaxVoltage define the lower and upper limits of the PPS 
range respectively (see Table 10.11, "SPR Programmable Power Supply Voltage Ranges" for required ranges). 
vPpsMinVoltage corresponds to the Minimum Voltage field in the PPS APDO and vPpsMaxVoltage corresponds 
to Maximum Voltage field in the PPS APDO. If the Sink negotiates for a new PPS APDO, then the transition between 
the two PPS APDOs Shall occur as described in Section 7.3.1, "Transitions caused by a Request Message".
