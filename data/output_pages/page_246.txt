  EPR_Source_Capabilities Message
The EPR_Source_Capabilities is an EPR Capabilities Message containing a list of Power Data Objects that the EPR 
Source is capable of supplying. It is sent by an EPR Source in order to convey its Capabilities to a Sink. An EPR Source 
Shall send the EPR_Source_Capabilities Message:

When entering EPR Mode

While in EPR Modes when its Capabilities change

In response to an EPR_Get_Source_Cap Message

After a Soft Reset while in EPR Mode
An EPR Sink operating in EPR Mode Shall evaluate every EPR_Source_Capabilities Message it receives and Shall 
respond with a EPR_Request Message. If its power consumption exceeds the Source Capabilities, it Shall Re-
negotiate so as not to exceed the Source's most recently Advertised Source Capabilities.
While operating in SPR Mode, an EPR Sink receiving an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message in response to an 
EPR_Get_Source_Cap Messages Shall Not respond with an EPR_Request Message.
The (A)PDOs in an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message Shall only be requested using the EPR_Request Message and 
only when in EPR Mode.
When Source wants to exit EPR Mode, if not already in power contract with an SPR (A)PDO, it Shall send an 
EPR_Source_Capabilities Message with no EPR (A)PDOs (i.e. seven SPR (A)PDOs including any zero padded ones). 
See Figure 6.55, "EPR_Source_Capabilities message with no EPR PDOs".

  EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message
The EPR_Sink_Capabilities is an EPR Capabilities Message that contains a list of Power Data Objects that the EPR 
Sink requires to operate. It is sent by an EPR Sink in order to convey its power requirements to an EPR Source. The 
EPR Sink Shall only send the EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message in response to an EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message.
