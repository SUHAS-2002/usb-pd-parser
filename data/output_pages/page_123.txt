Figure 6.4 Example Security_Request sequence Unchunked (Chunked bit = 0)
Figure 6.5, "Example byte transmission for Security_Request Message of Data Size 7 (Chunked bit is set to zero)" 
details the Security_Request Message shown in Figure 6.4, "Example Security_Request sequence Unchunked 
(Chunked bit = 0)". The figure shows the byte ordering on the bus as well as the fact that there is no padding in this 
case. The Number of Data Objects field has a value of 0 since it is Reserved when the Chunked bit is zero. The Data 
Size field indicates the length of the Extended Message when the Chunked bit is set to 0, which in this case is 7 bytes.

zero)
Figure 6.6, "Example byte transmission for Security_Response Message of Data Size 30 (Chunked bit is set to zero)" 
details the Security_Response Message shown in Figure 6.4, "Example Security_Request sequence Unchunked 
(Chunked bit = 0)". The figure shows the byte ordering on the bus as well as the fact that there is no padding in this 
case. The Number of Data Objects field has a value of 0 since it is Reserved when the Chunked bit is zero. The Data 
Size field indicates the length of the Extended Message when the Chunked bit is set to zero, which in this case is 30 
bytes.
