7.3.1.1.1.3
  Increasing the Voltage and Decreasing the Current
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when changing from 
one (A)PDO to another while increasing the voltage and decreasing the current is shown in Figure 7.24, "Transition 
Diagram for Increasing the Voltage and Decreasing the Current". The sequence that Shall be followed is described 
in Table 7.3, "Sequence Description for Increasing the Voltage and Decreasing the Current". The timing parameters 
that Shall be followed are listed in Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical 
Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.24, "Transition Diagram for Increasing the Voltage and Decreasing the Current", the Sink has 
previously sent a Request Message to the Source.
