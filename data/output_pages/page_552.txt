PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the PS_RDY 
Message. Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the PS_RDY Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
31
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the PS_RDY 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
32
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received PS_RDY 
Message information to the Policy Engine that 
consumes it. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSSourceOnTimer, informs the power supply that it can 
start consuming power.
33
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
34
PHY Layer receives GoodCRC Message and compares 
the CRC it calculated with the one sent to verify the 
Message.
PHY Layer appends a CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message. The Policy Engine stops the 
PSSourceOnTimer, informs the power supply it can 
now sink power and resets the Protocol Layer.
35
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
to the Protocol Layer. 
36
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the 
PS_RDY Message was successfully sent. The Policy 
Engine resets the CapsCounter, resets the Protocol 
Layer and starts the SwapSourceStartTimer which 
must timeout before sending any Source_Capabilities 
Messages.
The Power Role Swap is complete, the Power Roles have been reversed and the Port Partners are free to Negotiate for more 
power.
