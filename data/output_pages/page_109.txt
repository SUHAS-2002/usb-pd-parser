  Fast Role Swap Transmission
The Fast Role Swap process is intended for use by a PDUSB Hub that presently has an external supply and is 
providing power both through its downstream Ports to USB Devices and upstream to a USB Host such as a laptop. 
On removal of the external wall supply Fast Role Swap enables a VBUS supply to be maintained by allowing the USB 
Host to apply vSafe5V when it sees VBUS droop below vSafe5V after having detected Fast Role Swap Signaling. The 
Fast Role Swap AMS is then used to correctly assign Source/Sink Power Roles and configure the Rp/Rd resistors (see 
Section 8.3.2.8, "Fast Role Swap").
The Initial Source Shall signal a Fast Role Swap Request by driving CC to ground with a resistance of less than 
rFRSwapTx for tFRSwapTx. The Initial Source Shall only send a Fast Role Swap Request when it has an Explicit 
Contract. The Initial Source May send a Fast Role Swap Request even if it has not yet had its Sink Capabilities queried 
by the Initial Sink. On transmission of the Fast Role Swap Request any pending Messages Shall be Discarded (see 
Section 6.12.2.2.1, "Common Protocol Layer Message Transmission State Diagram").
The Fast Role Swap Signaling May override any active transmissions. 
Since the Initial Sink's response to the Fast Role Swap signal is to send an FR_Swap Message, the Initial Source Shall 
ensure Rp is set to SinkTxOK once the Fast Role Swap Signaling is complete.
