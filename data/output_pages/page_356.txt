  Decreasing the Voltage and the Current
The interaction of the System Policy, Device Policy, and power supply that Shall be followed when changing from 
one (A)PDO to another while decreasing the voltage and current is shown in Figure 7.28, "Transition Diagram for 
no change in Current or Voltage". The sequence that Shall be followed is described in Table 7.6, "Sequence 
Description for Decreasing the Voltage and the Current". The timing parameters that Shall be followed are listed in 
Table 7.23, "Source Electrical Parameters", Table 7.24, "Sink Electrical Parameters", and Table 7.25, "Common 
Source/Sink Electrical Parameters".
Note:
In Figure 7.27, "Transition Diagram for Decreasing the Voltage and the Current", the Sink has previously 
sent a Request Message to the Source.
