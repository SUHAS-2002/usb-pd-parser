  Dual-Role Source Gets Source Capabilities from a Dual-Role EPR 
Sink
Figure 8.69, "Dual-Role Source Gets Dual-Role Sink's Capabilities as an EPR Source" shows an example sequence 
between a Dual-Role Power Source and a Dual-Role Power Sink when the Source gets the Sink Capabilities as an EPR 
Source.
