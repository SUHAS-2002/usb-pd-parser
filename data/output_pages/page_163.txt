
Unstructured VDMs Shall only be used during Modal Operation in the context of an Active Mode i.e., only 
after the UFP has Ack'ed the Enter Mode Command can Unstructured VDMs be sent or received. The 
Active Mode and the associated Unstructured VDMs Shall use the same SVID.

Unstructured VDMs May be used with SOP* Packets.

When a DFP or UFP does not support Unstructured VDMs or does not recognize the VID it Shall return 
a Not_Supported Message.
Table 6.28, "Unstructured VDM Header" illustrates the VDM Header bits.
6.4.4.1.1
  USB Vendor ID
The Vendor ID (VID) field Shall contain the 16-bit Vendor ID value assigned to the vendor by the USB-IF (VID). No 
other value Shall be present in this field.
6.4.4.1.2
  VDM Type
The VDM Type field Shall be set to zero indicating that this is an Unstructured VDM.
6.4.4.2
  Structured VDM
Setting the VDM Type field to 1 (Structured VDM) defines the use of bits B14…0 in the Structured VDM Header. The 
fields in the Structured VDM Header are defined in Table 6.29, "Structured VDM Header".
The following rules apply to the use of Structured VDM Messages:

Structured VDMs Shall only be used when an Explicit Contract is in place with the following exception:

Prior to establishing the First Explicit Contract, a Source May issue Discover Identity Messages, to a 
Cable Plug using SOP’ Packets, as an Initiator (see Section 8.3.3.25.3, "Source Startup Structured VDM 
Discover Identity of a Cable Plug State Diagram").

Either Port May be an Initiator of Structured VDMs except for the Enter Mode and Exit Mode Commands 
which Shall only be initiated by the DFP.

A Cable Plug Shall only be a Responder to Structured VDMs.

Structured VDMs Shall Not be initiated or responded to under any other circumstances.

When a DFP or UFP does not support Structured VDMs any Structured VDMs received Shall return a 
Not_Supported Message.

When using any of the SVID Specific Commands in the Structured VDM Header (VDM Header b4…0 - 
value 16 - 31) the Responder Shall NAK Messages where the SVID in the VDM Header is not recognized 
as an SVID that uses SVID Specific Commands or the use of SVID Specific Commands is not supported for 
the SVID.

When a Cable Plug does not support Structured VDMs any Structured VDMs received Shall be Ignored.
