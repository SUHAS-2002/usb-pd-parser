6.4.2
  Request Message
A Request Message Shall be sent by a Sink to request power during the request phase of an SPR power Negotiation. 
The Request Data Object Shall be returned by the Sink making a request for power. It Shall be sent in response to 
the most recent Source_Capabilities Message (see Section 8.3.2.2, "Power Negotiation") when in SPR Mode. A 
Request Message Shall return one and only one Sink Request Data Object that Shall identify the Power Data Object 
being requested.
The Source Shall respond to a Request Message with an Accept Message, a Wait Message or a Reject Message (see 
Section 6.9, "Accept, Reject and Wait").
The Request Message includes the requested power level. For example, if the Source_Capabilities Message 
includes a Fixed Supply PDO that offers 9V @ 1.5A and if the Sink only wants 9V @ 0.5A, it will set the Operating 
Current field to 50 (i.e., 10mA * 50 = 0.5A).
The request uses a different format depending on the kind of power requested.

The Fixed Supply Power Data Object and Variable Supply Power Data Object share a common format 
shown in Table 6.23, "Fixed and Variable Request Data Object".

The Battery Supply Power Data Object uses the format shown in Table 6.24, "Battery Request Data 
Object".

The PPS Request Data Object's format is shown in Table 6.25, "PPS Request Data Object".

The AVS Request Data Object's format is shown in Table 6.26, "AVS Request Data Object".
The Request Data Objects are also used by the EPR_Request Message when operating in EPR Mode. See Section 6.4.9, 
"EPR_Request Message" for information about the use of the EPR_Request Message.
A Source operating in EPR Mode that receives a Request Message Shall initiate a Hard Reset.
