Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification, Revision 3.2, Version 1.1, 2024-10
6.4.4.3.1.6
  Passive Cable VDO
The Passive Cable VDO defined in this section Shall be sent when the Product Type is given as Passive Cable. 
Table 6.41, "Passive Cable VDO" defines the Cable VDO which Shall be sent.
A Passive Cable has a USB Plug on each end at least one of which is a Cable Plug supporting SOP’ Communication. A 
Passive Cable Shall Not incorporate data bus signal conditioning circuits and hence has no concept of Super Speed 
Directionality. A Passive Cable Shall include a VBUS wire and Shall only respond to SOP’ Communication. Passive 
Cables Shall support the Structured VDM Discover Identity Command and Shall return the Passive Cable VDO in a 
Discover Identity Command ACK as shown in Table 6.41, "Passive Cable VDO".
