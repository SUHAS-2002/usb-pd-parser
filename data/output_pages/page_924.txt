8.3.3.21.2.1
  PE_INIT_VDM_SVIDs_Request State
The Policy Engine transitions to the PE_INIT_VDM_SVIDs_Request state from either the PE_SRC_Ready or 
PE_SNK_Ready state when:

The Device Policy Manager requests the discovery of the SVIDs of the Port Partner or a Cable Plug.
On entry to the PE_INIT_VDM_SVIDs_Request state the Policy Engine Shall send a Structured VDM Discover SVIDs 
Command request and Shall start the VDMResponseTimer.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_INIT_VDM_SVIDs_ACKed state when:

A Structured VDM Discover SVIDs ACK Command response is received.
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_INIT_VDM_SVIDs_NAKed state when:

A Structured VDM Discover SVIDs NAK or BUSY Command response is received or

The VDMResponseTimer times out.
