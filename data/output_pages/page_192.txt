  Command Processes
The Message flow of Commands during a Process is a query followed by a response. Every Command request sent 
has to be responded to with a GoodCRC Message. The GoodCRC Message only indicates the Command request was 
received correctly; it does not mean that the Responder understood or even supports a particular SVID. Figure 6.26, 
"Command request/response sequence" shows the request/response sequence including the GoodCRC Messages.
