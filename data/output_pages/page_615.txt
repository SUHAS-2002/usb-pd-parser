  VCONN Source Swap (Wait)
Figure 8.57, "VCONN Source Swap with Wait" shows an example where the Port requests a VCONN Swap which is 
delayed with a wait. During the process the Port Partners, keep their Power Role as Source or Sink, maintain their 
operation as either a Source or a Sink (power remains constant) and don't exchange the VCONN Source.
