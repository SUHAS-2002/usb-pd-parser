pBitRate
Maximum difference between the 
bit-rate during the part of the 
Packet following the Preamble 
and the reference bit-rate.
0.25
%
The reference bit rate is the 
average bit rate of the last 32 bits 
of the Preamble.
rFRSwapTx
Fast Role Swap Request transmit 
driver resistance (excluding cable 
resistance)
5
Ω
Maximum driver resistance of a 
Fast Role Swap Request 
transmitter. Assumes a worst case 
cable resistance of 15Ω as defined 
in [USB Type-C 2.4]. 
Note: Based on this value the 
maximum combined 
driver and cable resistance 
of a Fast Role Swap Request 
transmitter is 20Ω.
tEndDriveBMC
Time to cease driving the line 
after the end of the last bit of the 
Frame.
23
µs
Min value is limited by 
tHoldLowBMC.
tFall
Fall Time
300
ns
10% and 90% amplitude points, 
minimum is under an unloaded 
condition.
tHoldLowBMC
Time to cease driving the line 
after the final high-to-low 
transition.
1
µs
Max value is limited by 
tEndDriveBMC.
tInterFrameGap
Time from the end of last bit of a 
Frame until the start of the first 
bit of the next Preamble.
25

tFRSwapTx
Fast Role Swap Request transmit 
duration
60
120
µs
Fast Role Swap Request is 
indicated from the Initial Source 
to the Initial Sink by driving CC 
low for this time.
tRise
Rise time
300
ns
10% and 90% amplitude points, 
minimum is under an unloaded 
condition.
tStartDrive
Time before the start of the first 
bit of the Preamble when the 
transmitter Shall start driving 
the line.

Ω
Source output impedance at the 
Nyquist frequency of [USB 2.0] 
low speed (750 kHz) while the 
Source is driving the CC line.
