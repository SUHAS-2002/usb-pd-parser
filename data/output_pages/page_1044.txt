  FRS Process
After the initial setup is completed and the laptop has determined both that the Hub can request FRS and that the 
laptop is able and willing to supply the requested current, the system is ready to support FRS. This section 
describes the sequence of events that take place during a Fast Role Swap. The following figures and tables do not 
cover the actions of the Device Policy Manager or the Policy Engine. Those actions occur orthogonally to the 
electrical events shown in this appendix. However, the diagrams do indicate the inputs/outputs where the DPM 
and Policy Engine interact with the electrical events:

The laptop sends the FR_Swap Message to initiate the FRS AMS (see Figure 7.43, "Transition Diagram for 
Fast Role Swap") within 15ms after the laptop detects the Fast Role Swap Request on CC.

The laptop sends the final PS_RDY Message in the FRS AMS only after it is sourcing VBUS.
