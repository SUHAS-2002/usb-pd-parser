  Wait Timers and Times
6.6.4.1
  SinkRequestTimer
The SinkRequestTimer is used to ensure that the time before the next Sink Request Message, after a Wait Message 
has been received from the Source in response to a Sink Request Message, is a minimum of tSinkRequest min (see 
Section 6.3.12, "Wait Message").
The SinkRequestTimer Shall be started when the EOP of a Wait Message has been received and Shall be stopped 
if any other Message is received or during a Hard Reset.
The Sink Shall wait at least tSinkRequest, after receiving the EOP of a Wait Message sent in response to a Sink 
Request Message, before sending a new Request Message. Whenever there is a SinkRequestTimer timeout the Sink 
May send a Request Message. It Shall then re-initialize and restart the SinkRequestTimer. 
6.6.4.2
  tPRSwapWait
The time before the next PR_Swap Message, after a Wait Message has been received in response to a PR_Swap 
Message is a minimum of tPRSwapWait min (see Section 6.3.12, "Wait Message"). The Port Shall wait at least 
tPRSwapWait after receiving the EOP of a Wait Message sent in response to a PR_Swap Message, before sending a 
new PR_Swap Message.
6.6.4.3
  tDRSwapWait
The time before the next DR_Swap Message, after a Wait Message has been received in response to a DR_Swap 
Message is a minimum of tDRSwapWait min (see Section 6.3.12, "Wait Message"). The Port Shall wait at least 
tDRSwapWait after receiving the EOP of a Wait Message sent in response to a DR_Swap Message, before sending 
a new DR_Swap Message.
6.6.4.4
  tVCONNSwapWait
The time before the next VCONN_Swap Message, after a Wait Message has been received in response to a 
VCONN_Swap Message is a minimum of tVCONNSwapWait min (see Section 6.3.12, "Wait Message"). The Port Shall 
wait at least tVCONNSwapWait after receiving the EOP of a Wait Message sent in response to a VCONN_Swap 
Message, before sending a new VCONN_Swap Message.
6.6.4.5
  tVCONNSwapDelayDFP
The time delay for DFP after losing VCONN Source role due to an incoming VCONN Swap request from UFP and before 
sending the next VCONN_Swap Message. The DFP Shall wait at least tVCONNSwapDelayDFP after sending the EOP 
of the GoodCRC Message in response to PS_RDY Message received at the end of the previous VCONN Swap AMS.
6.6.4.6
  tVCONNSwapDelayUFP
The time delay for UFP after losing VCONN Source role due to an incoming VCONN Swap request from DFP and before 
sending the next VCONN_Swap Message. The UFP Shall wait at least tVCONNSwapDelayUFP after sending the EOP 
of the GoodCRC Message in response to PS_RDY Message received at the end of the previous VCONN Swap AMS.
6.6.4.7
  tEnterUSBWait
The time before the next Enter_USB Message, after a Wait Message has been received in response to a Enter_USB 
Message is a minimum of tEnterUSBWait min (see Section 6.3.12, "Wait Message"). The DFP Shall wait at least 
tEnterUSBWait after receiving the EOP of a Wait Message sent in response to an Enter_USB Message, before 
sending a new Enter_USB Message.
6.6.5
  Power Supply Timers
See Section 7.3, "Transitions" for diagrams showing the usage of the timers in this section.
