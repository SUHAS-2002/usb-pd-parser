Table 8.144, "Steps for BIST Test Data Test" below provides a detailed explanation of what happens at each labeled 
step in Figure 8.117, "BIST Test Data Test" above.

Step
Tester
UUT
1
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a BIST Message, with a BIST Data Object of 
BIST Test Data, to put the UUT into BIST Test Data 
Mode.
2
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
3
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the BIST Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the BIST Message and checks the CRC 
to verify the Message.
4
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the BIST 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
5
Protocol Layer checks the MessageID in the incoming 
Message is different from the previously stored value 
and then stores a copy of the new value.
The Protocol Layer forwards the received BIST Message 
information to the Policy Engine that consumes it.
The Policy Engine goes into BIST Test Data Mode Mode 
where it sends no further Messages except for GoodCRC 
Messages in response to received Messages (see Section 
6.4.3.2, "BIST Test Data Mode").
6
Protocol Layer generates a GoodCRC Message and 
passes it PHY Layer.
7
PHY Layer receives the GoodCRC and checks the CRC to 
verify the Message.
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the GoodCRC 
Message.
8
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the GoodCRC 
Message to the Protocol Layer. 
9
Protocol Layer verifies and increments the 
MessageIDCounter and stops CRCReceiveTimer. 
Protocol Layer informs the Policy Engine that the BIST 
Message was successfully sent. 
UUT enters BIST Test Data Mode.
10
The Policy Engine directs the Protocol Layer to 
generate a BIST Message, with a BIST Data Object of 
BIST Test Data, to put the UUT into BIST Test Data 
Mode.
11
Protocol Layer creates the Message and passes to PHY 
Layer.
12
PHY Layer appends CRC and sends the BIST Message. 
Starts CRCReceiveTimer.
PHY Layer receives the BIST Message and checks the CRC 
to verify the Message.
13
PHY Layer removes the CRC and forwards the BIST 
Message to the Protocol Layer.
