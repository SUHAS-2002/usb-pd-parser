
If the Soft Reset process cannot be completed a Hard Reset will be issued within tHardReset of 
the CRCReceiveTimer to restore VBUS to USB Default Operation within ~1-1.5s:

When the Source is also the VCONN Source, VCONN will also be power cycled during the Hard 
Reset.

When the Source operating in SPR PPS Mode fails to receive periodic communication (e.g., a Request 
Message) from the Sink within tPPSTimeout:

Source issues a Hard Reset and takes VBUS to vSafe5V.

When the Source operating in the EPR Mode fails to receive periodic communication (i.e., an 
EPR_KeepAlive Message or any other Message) from the Sink within tSourceEPRKeepAlive:

Source issues a Hard Reset and takes VBUS to vSafe5V.

Receiving no response to further attempts at communication is interpreted by the Source as an error 
(see Error handling).

Errors during power transitions will automatically lead to a Hard Reset to restore power to default 
levels.

Error handling:

Protocol Errors are handled by a Soft_Reset Message issued by either Port Partner, that resets 
counters, timers and states, but does not change the Negotiated voltage and current or the Port's 
role (e.g., Source, DFP/UFP, VCONN Source) and does not cause an exit from Modal Operation.

Serious errors are handled by Hard Reset Signaling issued by either Port Partner. A Hard Reset: 

Resets protocol as for a Soft Reset but also returns the power supply to USB Default Operation 
(vSafe0V or vSafe5V output) in order to protect the Sink.

Restores the Port's Data Role to DFP.

Restores the Port's power to its USB default state.

When the Sink is the VCONN Source it removes VCONN then the Source Port is restored as the VCONN 
Source.

Causes all Active Modes to be exited such that the Source is no longer in Modal Operation.

After a Hard Reset it is expected that the Port Partner will respond within tNoResponse. If this does 
not occur then nHardResetCount further Hard Resets are carried out before the Source performs 
additional Error Recovery steps, as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4], by entering the ErrorRecovery 
state.
