Protocol Layer sends the GoodCRC Message to the 
New Source and then stops the PSSourceOnTimer.
Policy Engine evaluates the PS_RDY Message from 
the New Source and tells the Device Policy Manager to 
instruct the power supply to draw current as the New 
Sink.
Protocol Layer receives the GoodCRC Message from 
the New Sink.

The power supply as the New Sink transitions from 
Swap Standby to drawing the power allowed by the 
Implicit Contract. The power supply informs the 
Device Policy Manager that it is operating as the New 
Sink. At this point subsequent Negotiations 
between the New Source and the New Sink May 
proceed as normal. The New Sink Shall Not violate 
the transient load behavior defined in Section 7.2.6, 
"Transient Load Behavior" while transitioning to and 
operating at the new power level. The time duration 
(t4) depends on the magnitude of the load change 
(iLoadStepRate).
