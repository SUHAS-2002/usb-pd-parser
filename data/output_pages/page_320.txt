7.1.4.3.1
  Adjustable Voltage Supply Voltage Transitions
The Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Shall transition VBUS over the defined voltage range in a controlled manner. 
The Output Voltage value in the AVS RDO defines the nominal value of the AVS output voltage after completing a 
voltage change and Shall settle within the limits defined by vAvsNew by tAvsSrcTransSmall for steps smaller than 
or equal to vAvsSmallStep, or else, within the limits defined by vAvsNew by tAvsSrcTransLarge for steps larger 
than vAvsSmallStep. Any overshoot beyond vAvsNew Shall Not exceed vAvsValid at any time. Any undershoot 
beyond vAvsNew Shall Not exceed vAvsValid at any time. The AVS output voltage May change in a stepwise or 
linear manner and the slew rate of either type of change Shall Not exceed vAvsSlewPos for voltage increases or 
vAvsSlewNeg for voltage decreases. The nominal requested voltage of all linear voltage changes Shall equate to an 
integer number of LSB changes. An LSB change of the AVS output voltage is defined as vAvsStep. An AVS Shall be 
able to supply the Negotiated current level as it changes its output voltage to the requested level if the change of 
output voltage is less than or equal to vAvsSmallStep relative to vAvsNew. All AVS voltage increases Shall result in 
a voltage that is greater than or equal to the previous AVS output voltage. Likewise, all AVS voltage decreases Shall 
result in a voltage that is less than or equal to the previous AVS output voltage. Any time the Source enters the AVS 
range of operation that voltage transition is considered a voltage step larger than vAvsSmallStep.
When the AVS voltage steps up or down, a PS_RDY Message Shall be sent within:

tAvsSrcTransLarge after the last bit of the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message for steps 
larger than vAvsSmallStep.

tAvsSrcTransSmall after the last bit of the GoodCRC Message following the Accept Message for steps 
less than or equal to vAvsSmallStep provided the voltage on VBUS has reached vAvsNew.
Figure 7.8, "AVS Positive Voltage Transitions" and Figure 7.9, "AVS Negative Voltage Transitions" below show the 
output voltage behavior of an AVS in response to positive and negative voltage change requests. The parameters 
vAvsMinVoltage and vAvsMaxVoltage define the lower and upper limits of the AVS range respectively:

For SPR AVS Sources there are two possible voltage ranges where the vAvsMinVoltage is always 9V and 
vAvsMaxVoltage is either 15V or 20V depending on the Source's PDP. See Table 10.9, "SPR Adjustable 
Voltage Supply (AVS) Voltage Ranges". 

For EPR AVS Sources vAvsMinVoltage corresponds to Minimum Voltage field (always 15V) in the EPR 
AVS APDO and vAvsMaxVoltage corresponds to Maximum Voltage field in the EPR AVS APDO. See 
Table 10.15, "EPR Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) Voltage Ranges" for required ranges.
