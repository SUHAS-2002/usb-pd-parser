Figure 6.53 Extended_Control Message
The Extended_Control Message types are specified in the Type field of the ECDB and are listed in Table 6.67, 
"Extended Control Message Types". The Sent by column indicates entities which May send the given Message 
(Source, Sink or Cable Plug); entities not listed Shall Not issue the corresponding Message. The "Valid Start of 
Packet" column indicates the Messages which Shall only be issued in SOP Packets.
6.5.14.1
  EPR_Get_Source_Cap Message
The EPR_Get_Source_Cap (EPR Get Source Capabilities) Message Shall only be sent by a Port capable of operating 
as a Sink and that supports EPR Mode to request the Source Capabilities and Dual-Role Power capability of its Port 
Partner. A Port that can operate as an EPR Source Shall respond by returning an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message 
(see Section 6.5.15.2, "EPR_Source_Capabilities Message"). A Port that does not support EPR Mode as a Source Shall 
return the Not_Supported Message.
An EPR Capable Sink Port that is operating in SPR Mode Shall treat the EPR_Source_Capabilities Message as 
informational only and Shall Not respond with an EPR_Request Message.
6.5.14.2
  EPR_Get_Sink_Cap Message
The EPR_Get_Sink_Cap (EPR Get Sink Capabilities) Message Shall only be sent by a Port capable of operating as a 
Source and that supports EPR Mode to request the Sink Capabilities and Dual-Role Power capability of its Port 
Partner. A Port that is EPR Capable operating as a Sink Shall respond by returning an EPR_Sink_Capabilities 
Message (see Section 6.5.15.3, "EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message"). A Port that does not support EPR Mode as a Sink 
Shall return the Not_Supported Message.
