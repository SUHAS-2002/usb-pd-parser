  VCONN Source Swap, initiated by VCONN Source (Wait)
Figure 8.54, "VCONN Source Swap with Wait, initiated by VCONN Source" shows an example sequence where the VCONN 
Source and tells its Port Partner to supply VCONN and is told to wait. During the process the Port Partners, keep their 
Power Role as Source or Sink, maintain their operation as either a Source or a Sink (power remains constant) and 
don't exchange the VCONN Source role.
