  Message Discarding
On receiving a received Message on SOP, the Protocol Layer Shall Discard any pending SOP* Messages. A received 
Message on SOP’/SOP’’ Shall Not cause any pending SOP* Messages to be Discarded. 
It is assumed that Messages using SOP’/SOP’’ constitute a simple request/response AMS, with the Cable Plug 
providing the response so there is no reason for a pending SOP* Message to be Discarded. There can only be one 
AMS between the Port Partners, and these also take priority over Cable Plug communications so a Message received 
on SOP will always cause a Message pending on SOP* to be Discarded.
Table 6.74, "Message Discarding" for details of the Messages that Shall/ Shall Not be Discarded.
