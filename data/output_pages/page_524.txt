  DFP Receives Data Reset where the UFP is the VCONN Source
This is an example of a Data Reset operation where the DFP receives a Data_Reset Message and the UFP is the VCONN 
Source. Figure 8.29, "DFP Receives a Data Reset where the UFP is the VCONN Source" shows the Messages as they flow 
across the bus and within the devices to accomplish the Data Reset.
