  Source Port Get Sink Capabilities Extended State Diagram
Figure 8.146, "Source Port Get Sink Capabilities Extended State Diagram" shows the state diagram for a Source on 
receiving a request from the Device Policy Manager to get the Port Partner's extended Sink Capabilities. See also 
Section 6.5.13, "Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message".

  PE_SRC_Get_Sink_Cap_Ext State
The Policy Engine Shall transition to the PE_SRC_Get_Sink_Cap_Ext state, from the PE_SRC_Ready state, due to a 
request to get the remote extended Source Capabilities from the Device Policy Manager. 
On entry to the PE_SRC_Get_Sink_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall send a Get_Sink_Cap_Extended Message and 
initialize and run the SenderResponseTimer.
On exit from the PE_SRC_Get_Sink_Cap_Ext state the Policy Engine Shall inform the Device Policy Manager of the 
outcome (capabilities or response timeout).
The Policy Engine Shall transition back to the PE_SRC_Ready state (see Figure 8.132, "Source Port State Diagram") 
when:

A Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message is received

Or SenderResponseTimer times out.
